               rather than pH, , or (as a simple model of boron speciation in
               seawater and incorporation into CaCO3 would predict).
               Furthermore, culture experiments have shown that in planktic

               profound effects on B/Ca ratios beyond those predicted by simple

               influence of both temperature and nutrient concentration
               ([PO43?]) on foraminiferal calcification and growth. The
               presence of two G.?bulloides morphospecies with systematically
               different calcification properties and offset stable isotopic
               compositions was identified within sampling populations using
               distinguishing morphometric characteristics. The calcification
               temperature and by extension calcification depth of the more
               abundant ?normal? G.?bulloides morphospecies was determined
               using $\delta$18O temperature estimates. Calcification depths
               vary seasonally with upwelling and were used to select the
               appropriate [CO32?], temperature, and [PO43?] depth measurements
               for comparison with area density. Seasonal upwelling in the
               study region also results in collinearity between independent
               variables complicating a straightforward statistical analysis.
               To address this issue, we use additional statistical diagnostics
               and a down core record to disentangle the respective roles of
               each parameter on G.?bulloides calcification. Our results
               indicate that [CO32?] is the primary variable controlling
               calcification intensity while temperature influences shell size.

              considered in organismal (physiological) and ecological
              (community) contexts continues to hamper progress. Environmental
              drivers typically elicit biphasic physiological responses, where
              performance declines at levels above and below some optimum. It
              is also well understood that species exhibit highly variable
              response surfaces to these changes so that the optimum level of
              any environmental driver can vary among interacting species.
              Thus, species interactions are unlikely to go unaltered under
              environmental change. However, while these nonlinear,
              species-specific physiological relationships between environment
              and performance appear to be general, rarely are they
              incorporated into predictions of ecological tipping points.
              Instead, most ecosystem-level studies focus on varying levels of
              ``stress'' and frequently assume that any deviation from
              ``normal'' environmental conditions has similar effects, albeit
              with different magnitudes, on all of the species within a

              nonclimatic drivers with indirect ecological responses. Using a
              series of simple models based on direct physiological responses

              environment-performance relationships among primary producers and
              consumers translates into community-level effects via trophic
              interactions. These models show that even in the absence of
              direct mortality, mismatched responses resulting from often

              shifts from naturally kelp-dominated to turf-dominated systems),
              herbivores can counter these shifts by consuming the additional
              productivity of competing species (e.g., turfs). Here, we test
              whether consumer plasticity in energy intake to maintain growth
              in varying environments can underpin changes in consumption that
              buffer varying levels of productivity. In response to carbon and
              nutrient enrichment, herbivores increased consumption of
              higher-quality food, which acted as a buffer against enhanced
              production, while maintaining organismal processes across varying
              abiotic conditions (i.e., growth). These results not only suggest
              plasticity in feeding behavior, but also in energy acquisition
              and utilization to maintain organismal processes. Such plasticity
              may not only underpin organismal homeostasis, but also
              compensatory dynamics that emerge from the aggregate of these
              responses to buffer change in community processes.",

               rivers have decreased from the mid-1980s onward, following
               reduction policies. Long time series spanning four decades
               (1975?2015) of nutrients, chlorophyll (Chl), and pH measurements
               in the Southern and Central North Sea were analyzed to assess
               the impact of both the warming and the de-eutrophication trends
               on Chl. The de-eutrophication process, detectable in the
               reduction of nutrient river loads to the sea, caused a decrease
               of nutrient concentrations in coastal waters under riverine
               influence. A decline in annual mean Chl was observed at 11 out
               of 18 sampling sites (coastal and offshore) in the period
               1988?2016. Also, a shift in Chl phenology was observed around
               2000, with spring bloom formation occurring earlier in the year.
               A long time series of pH in the Southern North Sea showed an
               increase until the mid-1980s followed by a rapid decrease,
               suggesting changes in phytoplankton production that would
               support the observed changes in Chl. Linear correlations,
               however, did not reveal significant relationships between Chl
               variability and winter nutrients or SST at the sampling sites.
               We propose that the observed changes in Chl (annual or seasonal)
               around 2000 are a response of phytoplankton dynamics to multiple

               (s) is mainly controlled by seawater B(OH)4?/HCO3? with a
               roughly constant partition coefficient of 1.48?$\pm$?0.15???10?3
               (2$\sigma$), and $\delta$11B in this species is offset below
               $\delta$11B of the borate in seawater by 3.38?$\pm$?0.71?
               (2$\sigma$). These values represent our best estimates with the

               culturing and sediment trap work is needed to improve our
               understanding of boron incorporation into N. pachyderma (s).
               Application of a constant KD of 1.48???10?3 to high resolution
               N. pachyderma (s) B/Ca records from two adjacent cores off
               Iceland shows that subsurface pCO2 at the habitat depth of N.
               pachyderma (s) (~50 m) generally followed the atmospheric CO2
               trend but with negative offsets of ~10?50 ppmv during 19?10 ka.
               These B/Ca-based reconstructions are supported by independent
               estimates from low-resolution $\delta$11B measurements in the
               same cores. We also calibrate and apply Cd/Ca in N. pachyderma
               (s) to reconstruct nutrient levels for the same down cores. Like
               today's North Atlantic, past subsurface pCO2 variability off
               Iceland was significantly correlated with nutrient changes that
               might be linked to surface nutrient utilization and mixing
               within the upper water column. Because surface pCO2 (at 0 m
               water depth) is always lower than at deeper depths and if the
               application of a constant KD is valid, our results suggest that

              the $\delta$11 B signatures of fossil skeletons and shells/tests
              of marine organisms. Existing studies demonstrate an acceptable
              level of reproducibility is achievable, but also typically show a
              level of accuracy outside the limits required by most
              applications. Here we investigate matrix interference effects as
              a cause of inaccuracy and imprecision. METHODS: Analyses were
              performed on a standard format Thermo Scientific Neptune Plus
              MC-ICP mass spectrometer coupled to a New Wave Research 193 nm
              ArF laser ablation system. The effects of matrix interference on
              $\delta$11 B analysis were investigated through analyses of a set
              of reference materials with differing B/Ca ratios. Three
              approaches to correct for matrix-induced effects were trialled:
              (1) use of matrix-matched standards, (2) utilisation of the
              relationship between $\delta$11 B inaccuracy and11 B/43 Ca, 11
              B/40 ArCa4+ or 11 B/Cainterference from three reference materials
              with known $\delta$11 B values and varying B/Ca ratios, and (3)
              direct characterisation of the (sloping) interference itself.
              RESULTS: Matrix interference from scattered Ca ions on 10 B can
              impede both the accuracy and the reproducibility of $\delta$11 B
              analysis by LA-MC-ICP-MS. Based on analyses of two in-house
              reference materials, deep sea coral PS69/3181 and inorganic
              calcite UWC-1, we find approach 2, following the 11
              B/Cainterference relationship, gives the best mean accuracies
              (within 0.4‰ of solution values) and external reproducibilities

              to analyses of an annual growth cycle of a Siderastrea siderea

  abstract  = "Abstract Climate and weather extremes are sporadically recurring
               events that may have major local or regional impacts on the
               society and the environment. These events are typically related
               to unusually high or low temperature, prolonged dry or wet
               conditions, heavy precipitation, or extreme winds. Extreme
               events are part of the overall climate and weather alongside
               average conditions and variability, and thus are not unexpected
               as such. Climate change is expected to affect not only means but
               also variability and extremes. Some inferences can be based on
               past and present observations, but analyses of especially rare
               events are hampered by the availability of long time series.
               Over time, depending on how far the on-going global warming
               takes us from the present and the past climate conditions, the
               weather and climate statistics may well come to shift in ways
               that are well outside observational data. This may lead to
               shifts in frequency, intensity and geographical distribution of
               different extremes. Indeed, projected changes in some extremes
               over the 21st century are quite robust, such as generally
               increasing warm and decreasing cold extremes. Possible changes
               in some other aspects, for example storms, remain much more
               uncertain. Science-based information both on robust findings and
               on relevant uncertainties on changing extremes can provide
               useful information for sectorial planning, disaster risk

              acid leaching (e.g. HNO3-HCl). However, various strong acid
              leaches were found to yield comparable results for sediment trace
              metals, except for chromium. Hence, trace metal data obtained by
              strong acid digestion could be merged into a comprehensive
              database (except for chromium), which was analysed by an ANOVA
              procedure. Sediment trace metal contents were normalized against
              a common standard, based on their grain size fraction and organic
              matter content. Spatial variations were investigated for four
              areas encompassing the entire Scheldt estuary within the periods
              1978--85 and 1986--90. For one specific area, mid-estuary, trace
              metal data were studied from 1959 to 1987. For each area and
              period considered, the sediment trace metal content was
              calculated at the average percentage <16$\mu$m and organic matter
              content of the whole data set. The results showed that: (1) The
              upper Scheldt estuary is strongly polluted by trace metals,
              especially cadmium; (2) Viewed in historic perspective, pollution
              of the Scheldt estuary by trace metals was maximal at the end of
              the 1950s but decreased considerably through the 1970s and again
              in the 1980s. Monitoring data of suspended matter composition and
              trace metal profiles in a radiodated sediment core tend to
              confirm this pollution history; (3) The trace metal content of
              the sediments decreases in the downstream direction due to mixing
              of metal-rich fluvial sediments and metal-poor marine sediments;
              (4) Although physical mixing is the most important process that
              controls the trace metal content of the sediments, evidence is
              presented for mobilization of cadmium with increasing salinity,
              whilst this is suggested for arsenic.",

               discussed in light of the fact that intersex and imposex have
               both been found to be irreversible. Because it is the objective

               useful information to interpret past conditions. While organic
               compounds, such as pesticides, may behave quite differently in
               the environment compared to inorganic substances, such as
               metals, one common feature is that for different reasons,
               sediments often act as a common sink. In this sense sites with a
               history of deposition and little reworking are of interest to
               both the palaeo-environmental scientists and pollution
               scientists. Estuaries are often areas of significant deposition
               and are attractive to the historical study of anthropogenic
               inputs, however, sediments are also subject to a wide range of
               physicochemical conditions (from fresh to marine water) that
               fluctuate both in space and time. Changing water and sediment
               geochemistry influences metal binding capacity and flocculation
               of fine particles and for these reasons estuaries are
               challenging for the pollution scientist. However, methods of
               sediment characterization, sample preparation, and analysis have
               been developed over time to help understand the geochemistry
               that influences sources and sinks of contaminants, and their
               pathways through the environment. This chapter provides an
               extensive review of sediment contaminant characterization,
               including the sources, pathways and fate of contaminants in
               estuaries. It details analytical procedures and explores
               considerations when interpreting results. It has a focus on
               Australian estuaries but is relevant to estuaries around the
               world. The main aims of this review were to provide
               multidisciplinary researchers with a tool to further their
               inquiry and to encourage further studies of
               pollution/contamination in estuaries.",

              in the laboratory and in the field using shell characters.
              Monthly counts along transects on an exposed rocky shore have
              shown that the age groups behave differently, dogwhelks in their
              first year migrating upshore, and returning to lower levels in
              the second year. Adults (three years or older) lived and laid egg
              capsules in the low shore. The most favourable situation for
              subsequent hatching of these capsules was where they were
              permanently submerged in sea water.The first requirement of
              recently hatched young was probably protection from water
              movement, but they soon gegan feeding on small mussels. The shell
              height attained by the end of the first winter was related to
              winter temperatures, but the main growing season was June to
              November. Adult size was attained in two years, after which the
              individuals did not usually grow, but those which did grow during
              the third or succeeding years may have been nonbreeders or have
              been castrated by the trematode Parorchis acanthus.The age
              structure of the population suggested that mortality rate
              decreased with age, and this was confirmed by calculating annual
              mortality rates for the first three years of life. Heavy
              mortality in the low shore during the first winter was due mainly
              to predation by purple sandpipers. In succeeding winters
              mortality was low, and predation, the main mortality factor, was
              restricted to the summer months. At this time Cancer pagurus was
              the most voracious predator, but it was active mainly in the low
              shore, and the upshore distribution of second year dogwhelks,
              which were preferred to other age groups, age groups also led to
              a more economical use of environmental resources, namely food,

               appears to correlate with the degree of wave action on the
               shore. The more common, 2n=26 morph is typically found on
               exposed shores subjected to a high degree of wave action,
               whereas those with higher chromosome numbers, up to the recorded
               maximum of 2n=36, are restricted to more sheltered environments.
               The polymorphism is thought to be Robertsonian in nature,
               involving centric (centromere) fission or fusion, but detailed
               analysis of the polymorphism has been restricted by lack of
               success in labelling individual chromosomes. Using a
               silver-staining technique for the nucleolar organiser regions
               (NORs), three pairs of chromosomes, in the basic 2n=26

               Dimorphismus in bezug auf die Chromosomenzahl. Die beiden
               numerischen Formen (untersucht in der Region von Roscoff,
               Bretagne, Frankreich) weisen die Haploidzahlen 13 und 18
               auf.2.Zwischen den beiden Formen besteht
               eineRobertson-Beziehung. F{\"u}nf metazentrischen Chromosomen
               (M) der Form 13 entsprechen 5 Paare akrozentrischer Elemente (A)
               der Form 18; je ein A-Chromosom ist einem Arm eines M-Chromosoms
               partiell oder total homolog. Die verbleibenden 8 Chromosomen
               sind nicht in den numerischen Dimorphismus einbezogen.3.Eine
               heterozygote A/M-Kombination f{\"u}hrt zur Bildung eines
               Trivalents in der Prometaphase der weiblichen Meiose.
               Entsprechend den 5 AM-Chromosomengruppen I bis V k{\"o}nnen 5
               normale Trivalente gebildet werden. Die Trivalenten sind
               individualisierbar und in Populationen beider numerischer Typen
               wiederzuerkennen. Innerhalb jeder AM-Chromosomengruppe sind die
               Kombinationen A/A, A/M und M/M frei realisierbar. Damit werden
               zwischen den beiden reinen Formen alle m{\"o}glichen numerischen
               und konstitutionellen {\"U}berg{\"a}nge
               geschaffen.4.Verschiedene Populationen weisen verschiedene Grade
               der Heterogenit{\"a}t f{\"u}r die beiden alternativen Formen der
               Chromosomen auf. Heterogene Populationen zeigen in verschiedenem
               Ma{\ss}e eine interindividuelle Variation der numerischen
               Konstitutionen und dementsprechend eine mittlere Haploidzahl
               zwischen den Grenzen 13 und 18. Die Gesamtheterogenit{\"a}t
               einer Population ist in bestimmter Weise den relativen
               H{\"a}ufigkeiten von A- und M-Chromosomen der verschiedenen
               Chromosomengruppen korreliert. In heterogenen Populationen
               beider numerischer Typen ist das M-Chromosom der Gruppe V
               relativ seltener, jenes der Gruppe III relativ h{\"a}ufiger als
               die M-Chromosomen der Gruppen I, II und IV; die letzteren
               verhalten sich in bezug auf die Frequenzen der A- und
               M-Chromosomen ann{\"a}hernd
               gleichartig.5.Gesamtheterogenit{\"a}t wie numerischer Typ stehen
               eindeutig in Beziehung zu {\"o}kologischen Faktoren des
               Habitats. Typ 13 bewohnt die nahrungsreichen exponierten
               Lokalit{\"a}ten der Gezeitenregion mit starker Wellenbewegung;
               Typ 18 besiedelt die vor Wellenbewegung gesch{\"u}tzten Orte,
               vorwiegend in der relativ nahrungsarmen Zone der
               BraunalgenAscophyllum nodosum. Die reinsten (homogenen)
               Populationen finden sich an Lokalit{\"a}ten mit den Extremen der
               Habitatsbedingungen; Orte mit intermedi{\"a}ren Eigenschaften
               werden von chromosomal intermedi{\"a}ren (heterogenen)
               Populationen bewohnt. Parallel zum {\"o}kologischen Gradienten
               der Gezeitenzone verl{\"a}uft ein chromosomaler Gradient.6.Die
               chromosomale Struktur und die {\"o}kologische Trennung der
               Populationen weisen darauf hin, da{\ss} die reinen Formen in
               bezug auf die Habitatsbedingungen adaptiv sind. Die
               Heterogenit{\"a}t einer intermedi{\"a}ren Kolonie ist deutbar
               auf Grund der Theorie des balancierten Polymorphismus. Die
               adaptiven Werte der Kombinationen A/A, A/M und M/M sind
               innerhalb jeder AM-Chromosomengruppe abh{\"a}ngig von den

               valves were found in four rivers in the UK (Rivers Yare,
               Waveney, Thames and New Bedford River). The material making up
               these malformations was the rare calcium carbonate polymorph
               vaterite. Vaterite is seldom found in the natural environment
               because it is less stable than the other calcium carbonate
               polymorphs (aragonite and calcite). In the few reported cases of
               vaterite formation in molluscs, it is usually related to unusual
               biomineralisation events such as shell regeneration, pearls and
               initial stages of shell formation. We compared two populations
               from the Rivers Yare and Waveney in the Norfolk Broads, UK, one
               (River Waveney) displaying dominantly the normal Corbicula shell
               form with aragonitic shells. In the River Yare population, all
               individuals sampled had shell deformations to different extents.
               These deformations were apparent as bulges on the inside of the
               ventral shell margin. X-ray diffraction confirmed that the shell
               material in the bulges of recently collected clams was vaterite.
               Other parts of the deformed shells were aragonitic. The shell
               deformations alter the shell morphology, leading to higher and
               wider shells. The shell microstructure is fibrous in the
               vateritic parts and crossed-lamellar in the aragonitic parts of
               deformed or non-deformed shells. The cause for the malformations
               is probably a disrupted biomineralisation process in the
               bivalves. Fossil Corbicula specimens from the late Pleistocene
               had similar deformations, suggesting that this is not a response
               to anthropogenic causes, such as pollution.",

  abstract  = "Over the next century, elevated quantities of atmospheric CO2
               are expected to penetrate into the oceans, causing a reduction
               in pH (−0.3/−0.4 pH unit in the surface ocean) and in the
               concentration of carbonate ions (so-called ocean acidification).
               Of growing concern are the impacts that this will have on marine
               and estuarine organisms and ecosystems. Marine shelled molluscs,
               which colonized a large latitudinal gradient and can be found
               from intertidal to deep-sea habitats, are economically and
               ecologically important species providing essential ecosystem
               services including habitat structure for benthic organisms,
               water purification and a food source for other organisms. The
               effects of ocean acidification on the growth and shell
               production by juvenile and adult shelled molluscs are variable
               among species and even within the same species, precluding the
               drawing of a general picture. This is, however, not the case for
               pteropods, with all species tested so far, being negatively
               impacted by ocean acidification. The blood of shelled molluscs
               may exhibit lower pH with consequences for several physiological
               processes (e.g. respiration, excretion, etc.) and, in some
               cases, increased mortality in the long term. While fertilization
               may remain unaffected by elevated pCO2, embryonic and larval
               development will be highly sensitive with important reductions
               in size and decreased survival of larvae, increases in the
               number of abnormal larvae and an increase in the developmental
               time. There are big gaps in the current understanding of the
               biological consequences of an acidifying ocean on shelled
               molluscs. For instance, the natural variability of pH and the
               interactions of changes in the carbonate chemistry with changes
               in other environmental stressors such as increased temperature
               and changing salinity, the effects of species interactions, as
               well as the capacity of the organisms to acclimate and/or adapt

               known about the response of strongly interacting species,

               shift concordantly or whether climate change will promote
               community disassembly. In rocky shore ecosystems, mussels are
               dominant foundation species that provide habitat and increase
               diversity of associated species. The New Zealand mussel guild is
               uniquely diverse as four species can be found within 1 m2 of
               shoreline. We integrated comparative ecophysiology and
               population ecology to evaluate whether air temperature sets
               elevational range limits and to quantify mussels' warming
               tolerances. Air temperature appears to set upper intertidal
               limits across mid-intertidal species, based on findings that (1)
               lethal thermal limits coincided with temperatures experienced at
               upper tide-height limits, (2) species with higher thermal
               tolerances occurred higher on shore, and (3) lethal tolerances
               were highest at our warmest site. Based on predicted body
               temperatures in year 2100, mid-elevation habitat-forming mussels
               are likely to experience an increase in the frequency of thermal
               events causing 50\% mortality at their upper elevation limit.
               Such events are predicted to occur 3.0--4.4 times more
               frequently in 2100 than present at a warmer site and to increase
               from 0 to 0.4/0.1 days per year for Perna/Aulacomya, but not
               Mytilus, at a cooler site. These results indicate that the
               mussel species' ranges are all likely to contract at warmer

  abstract  = "Oxygen and pH microelectrodes were used to investigate the
               microenvironment of the planktonic foraminifer Orbulina universa
               and its dinoflagellate endosymbionts. A diffusive boundary layer
               surrounds the foraminiferal shell and limits the O2 and proton
               transport from the shell to the ambient seawater and vice versa.
               Due to symbiont photosynthesis, high O2 concentrations of up to
               206\% air saturation and a pH of up to 8.8, i.e. 0.5 pH units
               above ambient seawater, were measured at the shell surface of
               the foraminifer at saturating irradiances. The respiration of
               the host--symbiont system in darkness decreased the O2
               concentration at the shell surface to <70\% of the oxygen
               content in the surrounding air-saturated water. The pH at the
               shell surface dropped to 7.9 in darkness. We measured a mean
               gross photosynthetic rate of 8.5 $\pm$ 4.0 nmol O2 h−1
               foraminifer−1. The net photosynthesis averaged 5.3 $\pm$ 2.7
               nmol O2 h−1. In the light, the calculated respiration rates
               reached 3.9 $\pm$ 1.9 nmol O2 h−1, whereas the dark respiration
               rates were significantly lower (1.7 $\pm$ 0.7 nmol O2 h−1).
               Experimental light--dark cycles demonstrated a very dynamic
               response of the symbionts to changing light conditions. Gross
               photosynthesis versus scalar irradiance curves (P vs Eo curves)
               showed light saturation irradiances (Ek) of 75 and 137 $\mu$mol
               photons m−2 s−1 in two O. universa specimens, respectively. No
               inhibition of photosynthesis was observed at irradiance levels
               up to 700 $\mu$mol photons m−2 s−1. The light compensation point
               of the symbiotic association was 50 $\mu$mol photons m−2 s−1.
               Radial profile measurements of scalar irradiance (Eo) inside the
               foraminifera showed a slight increase at the shell surface up to
               105\% of the incident irradiance (Ed).",

              extent environmental factors and genetic structure contribute to
              variation in prey selectivity among populations. We surveyed
              drilled mussels at sites across Oregon and California, USA, and
              used multiple regression and Mantel tests to test the effects of
              abiotic factors and Nucella neutral genetic relatedness on the

              Belgium and The Netherlands, large reductions (upto 90) in heavy
              metal emissions from land-based sources have been reported
              between 1985 and 2000. Recently, some studies in the Western

              efforts to reduce chemical pollution input into the North Sea.
              Since those early reductions, metal concentrations in mussels
              generally remained unchanged upto mid 90s. However, in recent
              times metal concentration in mussels have increased
              significantly, for example Cd in 2002 was almost 10 times the
              values in 1983 and similar to levels seen during the peak in the
              70s. Other metals also increased in the 90s also reaching levels
              seen in the 70s. As there is no indication of recent increase in
              metal input into the estuary, we suggest that increased metal
              concentrations observed in mussels in recent years especially in
              the upper estuary are most likely a result of changes in physical
              and chemical speciation and metal bioavailability. Such changes
              may be caused by changes in some water quality parameters in the
              estuary (i.e. increased dissolved oxygen, concentration of
              organic matter), resulting in conditions that favour releases of
              sediment-bound metals into the water column. The relationship
              between metal content and season showed very similar annual
              profiles in the polluted WS and less polluted ES. Thus, seasonal
              variations in metal concentrations appear to be largely
              controlled by biological processes, while total body burdens are
              dependent on environmental levels and bioavailability.",

               therefore are covered by seawater during high tide, $\delta$18O
               isotopes of shell carbonate were low − 2.48 $\pm$ 0.05‰,
               confirming that their shells were deposited under low salinity
               conditions, i.e., reflecting a contribution from 18O-depleted
               freshwater. $\delta$18O isotopes of shell carbonate became
               heavier with increasing salinity, with mean values of − 0.74
               $\pm$ 0.96‰ for Mytilus growing in tidal pools. We calculated,
               based on $\delta$18O isotopic composition standardized to a

               by using energy to calcify and modify their periostracum to
               protect the shells from dissolution. These findings suggest that

              ballast water and brine wastes, accidental spillage of oil and
              radioactive wastes, and the modification of coastal structures.
              Understanding the sources of marine pollution and their possible
              impacts allows us to measure the current mitigation and
              conservation strategies aimed at protecting marine ecosystems
              from further deterioration. This review assessed the status of
              marine pollution based on the literature with a focus on the sea
              in arid regions over the last four decades. The review also
              summarized the degree of contamination of heavy metals and
              petroleum hydrocarbons that accumulated in marine water,
              sediments and living organisms. In addition, the review
              critically suggested several mitigation strategies to alleviate
              the impacts of such pollutions. The key findings indicated that
              the oil and gas production and processing industries,
              desalination industries, sea traffic, urban development, and
              discharge of treated wastewater and ballast water along with
              seasonal upwelling, and climate change were the main contributors
              of marine pollution in these regions including the Sea of Oman.
              The major identified pollutants were heavy metals, petroleum
              hydrocarbons, organochlorine, tar, harmful algal blooms, marine
              debris, non-native species, and sediment that are posing severe
              threats to marine biodiversity and ecosystems. The occurrence of
              radionuclides in these regions seems to be smaller compared to
              the World Ocean because of the insignificant disposal of nuclear
              waste due to strict law enforcement and monitoring. However,

              corals, and from 39 to 52 ppm in ancient corals. For the ancient
              corals, linear correlations are observed in both $\delta$11B vs.
              B concentration and $\delta$11B vs. 1/B plots, but these
              correlations are not observed for modern corals. Two
              interpretations are presented to account for these observations
              and to test the potential of $\delta$11B for reconstructing
              paleo-ocean pH. The first interpretation assumes a thermodynamic
              partitioning of B between seawater and carbonates and shows that
              both boron isotopic compositions and concentrations can be used
              to calculate the pH of seawater in which corals grow. For our
              data, such a model requires that both the pH and the $\Sigma$CO2
              of the deglacial ocean was lower than present-day values. The
              second interpretation is based on the correlation observed for
              ancient corals between boron isotopic compositions and 1/B. We
              suggest that the measured boron isotopic compositions of ancient
              corals are caused by the mixing of a primary aragonite (the coral
              skeleton) and secondary aragonite precipitated from 10B-enriched
              reef pore fluids. The characteristics ($\delta$11B and B
              concentrations) of the diagenetic aragonite and the fluids from
              which it precipitates can be constrained. If this proves correct,
              only the non-recrystallised parts of ancient corals can be used
              for paleo-pH reconstructions. These recrystallisation processes
              did not affect the 234U/238U ratios of the corals.",

              ensues, whereas in snails kept in air the respiratory rate shows
              an initial rise followed by a fall prior to thermal death. The
              reasons for these two respiratory patterns are discussed. The
              temperatures at which snails enter heat coma are up to 10 °C
              lower than those which are lethal to the species so that heat

               paths when hungrier. In nature this ``area restricted
               searching'' would tend to keep dogwhelks in areas of high prey
               density and the increased ``directionality'' of movement of
               hungry dogwhelks would tend to take them away from areas of low
               prey density. Dogwhelks encountered different-sized mussels in
               the aquarium in frequencies significantly different from those
               presented, both in terms of numbers and of surface area. Water
               currents may have caused the bias. Dogwhelks inspected
               encountered mussels by crawling over them for $\approx$ 1--2 h.
               A proportion of mussels were rejected after inspection. Relative
               abundances of different-sized accepted mussels were
               significantly different from those of encountered mussels, the
               mean size of mussels in the diet increasing significantly with
               increasing size of the dogwhelks. Size selection became more
               pronounced as dogwhelks, previously fed on barnacles, became
               experienced with mussels. A mussel encountered by an experienced
               dogwhelk was more likely to be attacked if closer to the
               preferred size of 20--25 mm shell length than the previously
               encountered mussel. Accepted mussels were inspected for longer
               than rejected mussels, perhaps as a result of selection of the
               drilling site. Dogwhelks previously fed solely on barnacles
               drilled in random positions on the mussel shell at first, but
               after consuming six to seven mussels they had developed a
               significant tendency to drill in the thinnest area of shells up
               to 25 mm in length and in the area over the digestive gland of
               larger shells. This learned behaviour reduced the drilling time
               for smaller shells by $\approx$ 27\% and, whilst not reducing
               the drilling time for larger shells, it allowed direct access to
               the most profitable organs of the prey. Shells were penetrated
               at a rate of $\approx$ 0.36 mm·day−1. The percentage of mussel
               flesh extracted by adult dogwhelks decreased from $\approx$ 90\%
               for 10-mm to $\approx$ 60\% for 40-mm mussels, the discarded
               flesh being predominantly from the mantle and foot. The
               profitability of mussels, calculated as the ratio of predicted
               weight of flesh extracted to predicted handling time, increased
               monotonically with increasing mussel shell length. The learned
               tendency to drill in the thinnest part of the shell increased
               the profitability of mussels <25 mm by $\approx$ 17\%. Dogwhelks
               engaged in handling mussels were sometimes interrupted or
               displaced by contesting dogwhelks, with a probability that
               increased as handling of the prey progressed. Interlopers
               devalued the prey of occupant dogwhelks by prolonging drilling
               and ingestion, by stealing flesh, or by displacing the occupant.
               The learned tendency of the dogwhelk to drill over the digestive
               gland of larger mussels, allowing quicker access to the most
               profitable tissue, perhaps maximizes the average energy return
               from larger mussels when at risk from interlopers. The
               preference of dogwhelks for mussels smaller than those predicted
               to be the most profitable could reflect the devaluation of
               larger mussels by the risk from interlopers or the increased
               risks of predation, dislodgement or desiccation associated with
               longer handling times for larger mussels.",

              maintained at 17.5\%. S. Aerial exposure of snails maintained at
              30\%. S and 10°C water temperature resulted in an ingestion rate
              2.1 times faster than for snails constantly submerged suggesting
              that tidal emersion is not always stressful to intertidal
              carnivores. The postfeeding phase of the feeding cycle was
              shortened in dogwhelks subjected to aerial exposure. Although
              significant variation occurred in digestive-tubule cell lysosomal
              stability during the first cycle of fluctuating salinity, the
              variability had declined significantly by Day 21. This
              observation suggests that digestive tubule lysosomal stability
              becomes adapted to a fluctuating osmotic environment, although
              the initial changes in lysosomal stability are probably related
              to intralysosomal protein catabolism and production of amino
              acids for intracellular osmoregulation. Variations in the osmotic
              environment of T. lapillus have resulted in unexpected outcomes

              fluctuating salinity and aerial exposure.",

              a habitat commonly used by small molluscs in intertidal seaweed
              communities: red turf algae. Taxa caught in collectors include
              three brooding bivalves [Musculus sp., Lasaea sp., Transennella
              tantilla (Gould, 1853)] and small gastropods that produce benthic
              egg capsules and crawl-away juveniles (Barleeia spp.). Dispersal
              is accomplished by juveniles---and even sexually mature adults in
              the case of small-sized species --- drifting with water currents
              using mucous threads in at least some of the taxa found. Some of
              these molluscs have also been caught in off-bottom collectors
              placed away from the shore, in the middle of a bay. Findings

              effective dispersal mechanisms (at least at a local scale). It is
              probable that frequent drifting excursions in these taxa enhance
              rafting opportunities, which in turn may favor long distance

              structure the ecosystem?",

  abstract = "The distribution of mussel beds in the Wadden Sea of
              Schleswig-Holstein was mapped by aerial surveys from 1989 to
              1991. The number of mussel beds decreased from 94 in 1989 to 49
              in 1990, as a result of severe storms in early 1990. Thereafter
              only small changes were observed. The mussel beds that remained
              in 1990 were found only in the shelter of islands; all beds in
              exposed areas had disappeared between the surveys of 1989 and
              1990, leaving large areas without mussel beds. Storms are thus
              identified as a major factor limiting the distribution of mussel
              beds to the sheltered parts of the Wadden Sea. Beds in the
              exposed parts of the Wadden Sea are highly dynamic, whereas beds
              in sheltered areas may persist over long times. A comparison with
              distribution patterns of older surveys (from 1937, 1968 and 1978)
              revealed great similarities with the results of recent
              investigations, indicating a constant distribution pattern over a
              long period. The results are discussed in relation to
              eutrophication and the structure of the benthic communities of
              the Wadden Sea. It is concluded that any eutrophication-induced
              increase of the mussel population would be restricted to the
              sheltered parts of the Wadden Sea. Storms will largely determine
              whether the communities of a given area have to compete with
              mussels, which are most important filter feeders of the
              ecosystem. As competition for food is a major factor structuring
              the benthic communities of the Wadden Sea, it is assumed that
              storms indirectly affect all other communities, giving
              deeper-burying, storm-tolerant species a competitive advantage in
              exposed areas where epibenthic mussels are excluded. The impact
              of mussel fisheries will be different for persisting and dynamic
              beds: fishing on persisting beds in sheltered areas may remove
              the crucial reserve which mussel-feeding birds such as eiders or
              oystercatchers need in times of low mussel populations.",

               that the processes involved in sequestration provide a response
               which is proportional to the concentration of the pollutant in
               the environment. This assumption is considered in relation to
               the known cellular properties of the systems involved. Studies
               on the kinetics of uptake of certain metals in estuarine
               conditions have included the possibility that they can occur in
               non-polar, lipid-soluble forms which may penetrate cell
               membranes very rapidly. It is concluded that the uptake of these

               assumptions undertaken during biological monitoring programmes
               are, in fact, valid as a first approximation. Many heavy metals
               of interest to environmentalists are retained within the tissues
               by reactive ligands. These may be inducible, metabolized and
               excreted, and it is the `turnover' and availability of these
               ligands which may ultimately determine the final concentration
               of the metal in the animal. Models and experimental studies of
               these activities indicate that the ligands are either
               non-specific in nature and capable of binding a wide variety of

  abstract  = "Due to the high population densities in European countries and
               the fact that pollution prevention measures are either
               non-existent or have only recently begun to be implemented, the
               degree of coastal and freshwater pollution in Europe is quite
               high in certain regions. A number of examples from the marine
               and freshwater field are selected to illustrate specific
               pollution problems and to derive some general conclusions. These
               examples include studies on fish diseases in the North Sea,
               where two species of fish, dab (Limanda limanda) and cod (Gadus
               morhua), are frequently afflicted with externally visible
               diseases. In dab, the disease prevalences amounted to 40\% in
               certain areas. The locations of prevalence ``hot spots'' led to
               the conclusion that pollution might be causing the phenomenon.
               Highest disease prevalences were found in a dumping area for
               wastes from titanium dioxide production, in certain German,
               Danish, and British coastal waters, and on the Dogger Bank (an
               offshore area characterized by high organochlorine and heavy
               metal residues in fish). For coastal waters off Germany and
               Denmark contamination of gonads with PCBs in certain fishes was
               negatively correlated with the viable hatch. Also malformation
               rates were higher in fish embryos from dumping areas and along
               shipping routes than from other stations. PCBs were suspected
               also to be causative factors in the population declines of
               marine mammals in the Baltic between 1900 and 1970. Mercury
               contamination was identified as the paramount pollution problem
               in the Mediterranean where fish for human consumption display
               high contamination levels. Consequences for human consumption
               have not yet been evaluated. Studies on biological effects of
               pollution in the river Rhine were inconclusive despite the fact
               that this river must be considered to be one of the most heavily
               polluted river systems in Europe. Skeletal deformities of
               certain fish occurred in higher prevalences in the polluted
               stretches of the river than in control areas. On the other hand,
               the prevalence of neoplasia in fish livers was not unusually
               high in the polluted river. The example of the river Elbe
               highlights long term degradation of river water quality and its
               impact on biota and illustrates the scientific and public debate
               on the changes. The changes were too slow, and not dramatic
               enough to elicit immediate preventive action. The scientific
               debate on biological changes in the river started in 1798 when
               fishermen complained that their fishery had deteriorated, and
               continues today as scientists struggle to determine whether fish
               populations have decreased or not. From these examples it is
               concluded that scientific evidence for biological changes in
               marine and freshwater ecosystems is frequently debated and does
               not provide the basis needed for sound pollution management
               measures. The ability has to be developed, therefore, to read
               and interpret the signs of environment deterioration and to
               collect circumstantial evidence of ecological malfunctions.

              pollution history and to assess the impact of diagenetic
              processes. The sedimentation rates, based on 210Pb and 137Cs
              inventories, were 0.84--0.90 cm/yr in core E and 1.3--1.7 cm/yr
              in core K. The sediments show a vertical redox zonation with an
              oxic upper layer, where trace metals are mobilized, overlying a
              reduced layer where the metals are precipitated. Though these
              diagenetic processes have greatly modified the original trace
              metal distribution, anthropogenic maxima could be identified for
              Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, and Zn during the mid-sixties. A second pollution
              maximum was found at the end of the seventies for Cd, Cu, Pb, and
              Zn. The down-core distributions of Mn, Fe, total S, CaCO3, Sr,
              Co, and Ni are controlled by diagenetic processes, whereas the P
              profiles reflect both anthropogenic and diagenetic impacts. Rapid
              remobilization of trace metals occurs after their deposition on
              the marshes due to the occurrence of oxic conditions in the upper
              sediment layer, preventing precipitation of metal sulfides from
              the pore waters. Though the metals are partly reprecipitated in
              the reduced sediment layer (e.g. as sulfides), the inventory of
              the cores suggests that Cr is the only metal which is completely
              retained by the sediments. Slight losses are observed for Fe, Co,
              and Pb (11--14\%), moderate losses for Zn, Cu, and Ni (19--25\%),
              and high losses for P, Mn, and Cd (40--50\%). Similar
              mobilization of trace metals is to be expected in other salt

  abstract = "In recent decades, humans have become a very important force in
              the Earth system, demonstrating that emissions (gaseous, liquid,
              and solid) are the cause of many of our environmental issues.
              These emissions are responsible for major global reorganizations
              of the biogeochemical cycles. The oceans are now a net sink of
              atmospheric CO2, whereas in their preindustrial state they were a
              source; the trophic state of the coastal oceans is progressively
              moving toward increased heterotrophy; and the terrestrial realm
              is now vacillating between trophic states, whereas in
              preindustrial times it was autotrophic. In this paper, we present
              model calculations that underscore the role of human-induced
              perturbations in changing Earth's climate, specifically the role
              of anthropogenic nitrogen and phosphorus in controlling processes
              in the global carbon cycle since the year 1850 with projections
              to the year 2035. Our studies show that since the late 1940's
              emissions of nitrogen and phosphorus have been sequestered in the
              terrestrial living phytomass and groundwater. This
              nutrient-enhanced fertilization of terrestrial biota, coupled
              with rising atmospheric CO2 and global temperature, has induced a
              sink of anthropogenic CO2 that roughly balances the emission of
              CO2 owing to land use change. In the year 2000, for example, the
              model-calculated terrestrial biotic sink was 1730 Mtons C/year,
              while the emission of CO2 from changes in land use was 1820 Mtons
              C/year, a net flux of 90 Mtons C/year emitted to the atmosphere.
              In the global aquatic environment, enhanced terrestrial inputs of
              biotically reactive phosphorus (about 8.5 Mtons P/year) and
              inorganic nitrogen (about 54 Mtons N/year), have induced
              increased new production and burial of organic carbon in marine
              sediments, which is a small sink of anthropogenic CO2. It is
              predicted that the response of the global land reservoirs of C,
              N, and P to sustained anthropogenic perturbations will be
              maintained in the same direction of change over the range of
              projected scenarios of global population increase and temperature
              change for the next 35 years. The magnitude of change is
              significantly larger when the global temperature increase is

               estuary has been studied during eight axial surveys, carried out
               between February 1987 and February 1988. The observed
               metal-salinity profiles depend on the season. During spring and
               summer, when the river water is anoxic (containing traces of
               dissolved sulfide), the dissolved metal concentrations in the
               riverine endmember are extremely low. This observation is
               ascribed to formation of sparingly soluble metal sulfides in the
               water column. During winter, when the river water is not totally
               devoid of oxygen (10--40\% saturation), the dissolved Cu and Zn
               concentrations in the riverine endmember are an order of
               magnitude higher, but rapid removal is apparent in the very low
               salinity zone. Flocculation (of organometal complexes) or
               coagulation (of colloid-associated metals), sediment
               resuspension and formation of particulate Fe and Mn
               oxyhydroxides are likely to be involved in the removal process.
               At higher salinities, maxima of dissolved Zn (at 6--9 $\times$
               10−3), Cu (at 9--18 $\times$ 10−3), and Cd (at 12--21 $\times$
               10−3) are consistently found over the year. These maxima are
               ascribed to dissolution and desorption of particulate metal
               forms with increasing salinity. Reoxidation of trace metal
               sulfides during transport from the anoxic (or suboxic) upper
               estuary to the fully oxygenated lower estuary is suggested as
               the first step in the mobilization process. During phytoplankton
               blooms, desorption of Cd and Zn (but not Cu) is suppressed,
               which is attributed to the pH increase related to primary
               production, and to biological uptake. The impact of mobilization
               processes in the Scheldt estuary is reflected by effective
               dissolved Cd and Cu concentrations which are much higher than
               the observed metal concentrations in the river water. Based on
               these findings, it is expected that restoration of the dissolved
               oxygen concentration, which is a major goal of the present-day
               management of the Scheldt estuary, will lead to an increase in
               the dissolved metal transport to the North Sea.",

               incorporated differentially between nonequivalent vicinal faces
               that compose spiral growth hillocks. The step-selective
               incorporation pattern for boron anions is opposite to that
               observed for the tetrahedral anions SO42− and SeO42−.
               Independent work has shown that a tetrahedrally coordinated
               boron species is preferentially incorporated at the surface
               during growth, yet the boron in the bulk calcite is
               predominantly trigonally coordinated. Hence, there is a change
               in nearest-neighbor coordination of boron at the surface during
               incorporation. A possible explanation for the step-selective
               incorporation of boron lies in a surface-site control over the
               mechanism or rate of this coordination change. The findings
               demonstrate that multiple, structurally distinct surface anion
               sites exist on calcite \{1014\} faces, and inherent differences
               in these sites influence element incorporation and possibly
               surface kinetics. This behavior parallels the known differences
               for incorporation among surface cation sites and further
               confirms that trace and minor element partitioning is strongly
               affected by the structural aspects of mineral surfaces. Such
               site selectivity and associated effects on potential

              and quantum chemistry were applied to the mechanism of this
              synergistic action. The solubility of BCP was markedly increased
              in proportion to elevation of aminopyrine (AM) concentration, but
              not by a combination with isopropylantipyrine (IP). The binding
              of BCP to bovine serum albumin was slightly inhibited by AM, but
              not by IP. The mixture of AM and BCP in aqueous media generated
              optical absorption in the ultraviolet differential spectrum, due
              to the charge transfer interaction. The results of the infrared
              or NMR spectrum demonstrated the formation of a hydrogen binding
              in non-aqueous media between BCP and AM. From the calculation of
              the charge on an atom, the energy of the highest occupied
              molecular orbital and the frontier electron density, BCP is
              considered to be a good electron acceptor. The beta-units of Mho
              of pyrazolones were found to correlate with the potentiation
              coefficient of analgesic activity in combination drugs. These
              results suggest that the complex formation between BCP and
              pyrazolones is an important factor for the synergism of action
              and is due to the charge transfer interaction and the hydrogen
              binding of both molecules.",

  abstract = "The study of the effects of environmental factors on the daily
              growth of Pecten maximus juveniles (one- and two-year olds) in
              the Bay of Brest was prompted by the decline of the scallop
              fishery in the Bay. Scallops over 30 mm in shell length were
              collected monthly from October 1994 to November 1995. Daily shell
              growth rings were counted using image analysis. Multiple stepwise
              regression analyses were performed to identify environmental
              parameters significantly affecting mean daily shell growth rates
              of one- and two-year-old juveniles in 1994 and 1995. Normal
              growth of Pecten shells is mainly regulated by bottom-water
              temperature, salinity and, to a lesser extent, river flow, rather
              than food. In 1995, three major toxic blooms of Gymnodinium cf.
              nagasakiense were recorded, leading to major reductions in shell
              growth rates. The effect of the toxic blooms on the natural
              Pecten populations was all the more important as no wild scallop
              spat settled on artificial collectors during the 1995 summer
              toxic events, and no pre-recruits originating from the 1995
              spawnings were sampled on the bottom, despite good-quality
              spawnings. Two growth retardations were observed for one-year-old
              juveniles during the summer of 1995: the first one appears to be
              related to the sedimentation of a Rhizosolenia
              delicatula--Chaetoceros sociale bloom. It is suggested that the
              large aggregates of these diatoms led to clogging of the scallop
              gills. The second growth decrease was explained by the first
              bloom of G. cf. nagasakiense. The second and third dinoflagellate
              blooms were not associated with daily growth rate decreases in
              one-year-old scallops. The toxic effect of the dinoflagellate
              blooms was greater for two-year-old than for one-year-old
              juveniles; higher filtration rates and/or a differently oriented
              metabolism, compared with younger individuals, would explain
              these variations.",

  abstract  = "Publisher Summary This chapter focuses on evolutionary
               significance of phenotypic plasticity in plants. The expression
               of an individual genotype is modified by its environment. The
               amount by which it can be modified is termed its plasticity.
               This plasticity can be either morphological or physiological;
               these are interrelated. The plasticity of a character is related
               to the general pattern of its development, and apart from this,
               that plasticity is a general property of the whole genotype.
               Plasticity of a character appears to be specific for that
               character, specific in relation to particular environmental
               influences, specific in direction, under genetic control not
               necessarily related to heterozygosity, and able to be radically
               altered by selection. Because plants are static organisms,
               plasticity is of marked adaptive value in a great number of
               situations. Examples of all these situations in plant species
               are discussed. They indicate that adaptation by plasticity is a
               widespread and important phenomenon in plants and has evolved
               differently in different species. The mechanisms involved in
               plasticity are varied. At one extreme, the character shows a
               continuous range of modification dependent on the intensity of
               the environmental stimulus. At the other, the character shows
               only two discrete modifications. The stimulus causing these
               modifications may be direct or indirect. The mechanisms found
               can be related to the particular environmental situation
               involved.",

               (Cd) accumulation, metallothionein (MT) induction and glycogen
               stores in N. lapillus exposed to Cd in water. Adult dogwhelks,
               with similar shell length (30.0$\pm$1.5 mm), were either starved
               or fed to satiation with barnacles Semibalanus balanoides,
               mussels Mytilus edulis or Cd-dosed M. edulis, and kept in
               filtered natural seawater (<0.01 $\mu$g Cd l−1) or
               Cd-contaminated (400 $\mu$g Cd l−1) seawater for 80 days.
               Mortality and individual growth rate were determined. Cd, MT and
               glycogen were measured in different tissues. Prolonged
               starvation and exposure to Cd significantly reduced the
               survivorship of N. lapillus, but feeding could help dogwhelks to
               combat Cd toxicity and minimise mortality. Extended starvation
               also caused tissue wastage, leading to higher concentrations of
               Cd and MT in tissues, whereas fed animals increased in weight
               and had lower Cd and MT concentrations because of the tissue
               dilution effect. Prey type significantly affected growth rate of
               dogwhelks and indirectly influenced Cd accumulation, MT
               induction and glycogen stores. Eating mussels promoted better
               growth and higher glycogen reserves than eating barnacles.

  abstract = "Fossil foraminiferal shells are utilized in paleoceanography to
              extract information about environmental conditions of the past
              ocean. Based on several assumptions, the ratio of 13C and 12C
              preserved in their shells is used to reconstruct, for example,
              the paleoproductivity or the oceanic pCO2. Metabolism of the
              living organism and the sea water chemistry, however, can
              influence the incorporation of carbon isotopes during
              calcification such that the signal of the shells differ from the
              signal of the sea water. These effects occur because the chemical
              microenvironment of the foraminifer (boundary layer thickness
              ∼500 $\mu$m) differs from the bulk sea water. Here, we present a
              numerical model that calculates the $\delta$13C of the
              foraminiferal shell as a function of the sea water chemistry and
              the magnitude of vital effects. Concentration profiles of the
              chemical species of the carbonate system within the
              microenvironment of foraminifera are obtained by solving
              diffusion-reaction equations. The compounds of dissolved forms of
              carbon dioxide containing either the stable carbon isotope 13C or
              12C are considered separately. Spherical symmetry of the
              foraminifer is assumed. The model outcome is compared to results
              from culture experiments with the planktonic foraminifer Orbulina
              universa. Model results indicate that the interaction between
              vital effects of the foraminifer and the sea water chemistry can
              account for changes in the $\delta$13C of foraminiferal calcite
              of 0.3--0.4‰ when glacial and interglacial sea water conditions
              are compared. These effects occur even though the $\delta$13C of

              changes in sea water chemistry should be distinguished from

               reports, however, suggest that it could play a major role in the
               evolution and biogeography of recent corals. We investigated the
               calcification rates of five colonies of the zooxanthellate coral
               Stylophora pistillata in synthetic seawater using the alkalinity
               anomaly technique. Changes in aragonite saturation from 98\% to

               The results show a nonlinear increase in calcification rate as a
               function of aragonite saturation level. Calcification increases
               nearly 3-fold when aragonite saturation increases from 98\% to
               390\%, i.e., close to the typical present saturation state of

               at saturation values above this threshold. Preliminary data
               suggest that another coral species, Acropora sp., displays a
               similar behaviour. These experimental results suggest: (1) that
               the rate of calcification does not change significantly within
               the range of saturation levels corresponding to the last
               glacial-interglacial cycle, and (2) that it may decrease
               significantly in the future as a result of the decrease in the
               saturation level due to anthropogenic release of CO2 into the
               atmosphere. Experimental studies that control environmental

               individuals per 100 m2 and the population was dominated by
               full-grown specimens exceeding 50 mm shell height. The highest
               abundance of spat, juveniles and adults was found in the deeper
               central section of the Oyster Ground that is stratified during
               summer. There, the mean density was 21 individuals (>10 mm) per
               100 m2. These densities were much lower than in the northern
               North Sea (Fladen Ground), where abundance was one to two orders
               of magnitude higher and peaked at 28600 individuals per 100 m2.
               In the Fladen Ground, the population structure was bimodally
               shaped and dominated by juveniles. In the Oyster Ground, the
               skewed size class distribution suggests that the recruitment to
               larger size classes is hampered. An insufficiently dense stock
               of reproducing adults generating less dense spatfalls, possibly
               in combination with limited survival of spat and juveniles,
               prevents successful recruitment. Although natural processes may
               contribute to the skewed population structure, intensive bottom
               trawling is thought to have a major effect as well. It is
               therefore questionable whether under present-day conditions the
               population of Arctica in the SE North Sea can be considered
               sustainable in the long term.",

               often seem to co-occur in seawater samples. The concentrations
               of zinc in seawater are anomalously high. A large fraction of
               the zinc entering the oceans of the world is derived from aerial
               deposition. Between 11,000 and 60,000 metric tons of dissolved
               and particulate zinc is deposited from the air into the ocean
               each year. An additional 6,000 tons of dissolved zinc enters the
               oceans each year in river flows. Flux rates of zinc from the
               atmosphere vary widely in different geographic regions. Zinc
               concentrations in estuaries and coastal waters frequently are
               much higher than those in the ocean, with concentrations often
               as high as 4 $\mu$g/L and occasionally as high as 25 $\mu$g/L. A
               large fraction of the zinc in contaminated and uncontaminated

  abstract = "The crossed lamellar microstructure of mollusk shells shows a
              very complex hierarchical architecture constituted of long
              rod-shaped aragonite crystals stacked parallel to each other
              inside each first order lamella, which are almost perpendicular
              to the ones contained in parallel neighboring lamellae. To better
              understand the construction and properties of the crossed
              lamellar microstructure we have performed a detailed study to
              determine the crystallographic characteristics and their
              evolution during shell growth using scanning electron microscopy,
              transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction texture
              analysis. The arrangement of crystals is rationalized by a set of
              twin law relationships between aragonite crystals. Specifically,
              the aragonite rods, or third order lamellae within each first
              order lamella, internally consist of polysynthetic twins bounded
              by \{110\} mirror planes. In turn, the polysynthetically twinned
              aragonite crystals also show a constant crystallographic
              orientation with respect to aragonite crystals in adjacent first
              order lamellae. It can be seen as another twin law in which
              crystals from adjacent lamellae are bounded by (110) planes but
              with their c-axes rotated within this plane by 30°. Thus there
              are two sets of twin laws that relate crystal units at lower
              (third order lamellae) and higher (first order lamellae) length
              scales. These hierarchical relationships play a crucial role in
              the construction, organization and properties of this complex
              microstructure. The later orientational relationships have never
              been described in geological aragonite and are only found in
              biogenic materials with a crossed lamellar microstructure. Their
              occurrence is probably determined by the presence of shell
              organic components which regulate crystal growth and may favor
              unusual crystallographic relationships.",

              ions abounds. Attention has focused, however, on the effects of
              K+, Na+ and Mg2+ on the biomineralization of nacre, and those of
              other metal ions have been relatively neglected. This paper
              investigated the effects of representative copper (II) on the
              biomineralization of CaCO3 using egg white as the organic matrix.
              The effects of copper ion concentration, aging time and the
              combined actions of a high concentration of both egg white and
              Cu2+ on the morphology and crystal type of CaCO3 were studied,
              and the action mechanism was analyzed. The results show that
              copper (II) can induce the formation of vaterite, promote the
              spheroidization of mineralized particles, distort and deform the
              lamellar structure, and affect the surface roughness. Mechanism
              analysis shows that the bending and twisting of the protein
              molecule chain caused by the biuret reaction of Cu2+ with
              egg-white protein is the primary reason for the effects of copper

              show a regular alternation of 100--200$\mu$m wide annual growth
              rings. Combination of these results with a previous study
              (Marschal et al., 2004) suggests that Mg-rich rings form during
              the period spring to early fall, while S-rich rings form

              periods of time. Although overall decreases of the Mg/Ca and
              Sr/Ca are observed as a function of depth (and temperature), the
              use of these ratios as an indication of the sea water temperature
              (SWT) seems difficult. In addition, a single colony that grew in
              an area where the temperature was monitored for 30years did not
              register the measured increase of SWT of about 1°C. However, Mg
              and OM distributions inside skeletons could be good indicators of
              variations of growth rates on decadal time scales and anomalous
              `summer suffering' events that could be associated with periods
              of unusually high SWT conditions. The red coral is thus an
              example of how growth dynamics (and not temperature alone)
              affects the chemistry of biominerals.",

              precision, short term information is lost due to the pooling of
              tests with distinct and diverse boron isotope signatures

              test the limits of precision of LA-MC-ICP-MS on the planktonic
              foraminifera Orbulina universa. The results show that relative

               to critically assess the use of bivalve mollusks in chemical
               monitoring (identification and quantification of pollutants) and
               biomonitoring (estimation of environmental quality). Many
               authors, however, have considered these approaches within a
               single context, i.e., as a means of chemical (e.g. metal)
               monitoring. Bivalves are able to accumulate substantial amounts
               of metals from ambient water, but evidence for the drastic
               effects of accumulated metals (e.g. as a TBT-induced shell
               deformation and imposex) on the health of bivalves has not been
               documented. Metal bioaccumulation is a key tool in
               biomonitoring; bioavailability, bioaccumulation, and toxicity of
               various metals in relation to bivalves are described in some
               detail including the development of biodynamic metal
               bioaccumulation model. Measuring metal in the whole-body or the
               tissue of bivalves themselves does not accurately represent true
               contamination levels in the environment; these data are critical
               for our understanding of contaminant trends at sampling sites.
               Only rarely has metal bioaccumulation been considered in
               combination with data on metal concentrations in parts of the
               ecosystem, observation of biomarkers and environmental
               parameters. Sclerochemistry is in its infancy and cannot be

  abstract = "Summary Background The question of how many marine species exist
              is important because it provides a metric for how much we do and
              do not know about life in the oceans. We have compiled the first
              register of the marine species of the world and used this
              baseline to estimate how many more species, partitioned among all
              major eukaryotic groups, may be discovered. Results There are
              ∼226,000 eukaryotic marine species described. More species were
              described in the past decade (∼20,000) than in any previous one.
              The number of authors describing new species has been increasing
              at a faster rate than the number of new species described in the
              past six decades. We report that there are ∼170,000 synonyms,
              that 58,000--72,000 species are collected but not yet described,
              and that 482,000--741,000 more species have yet to be sampled.
              Molecular methods may add tens of thousands of cryptic species.
              Thus, there may be 0.7--1.0 million marine species. Past rates of
              description of new species indicate there may be 0.5 $\pm$ 0.2
              million marine species. On average 37\% (median 31\%) of species
              in over 100 recent field studies around the world might be new to
              science. Conclusions Currently, between one-third and two-thirds
              of marine species may be undescribed, and previous estimates of
              there being well over one million marine species appear highly
              unlikely. More species than ever before are being described
              annually by an increasing number of authors. If the current trend
              continues, most species will be discovered this century.",

              from the marine realm are limited because they largely come from
              experiments using limited numbers of species [3], mesocosms whose
              interior conditions are unnatural [4], and long-term correlation
              studies based on historical collections [5]. We describe the
              first ever experiment to warm benthic assemblages to ecologically
              relevant levels in situ. Heated settlement panels were used to
              create three test conditions: ambient and 1°C and 2°C above
              ambient (predicted in the next 50 and 100 years, respectively
              [6]). We observed massive impacts on a marine assemblage, with
              near doubling of growth rates of Antarctic seabed life. Growth
              increases far exceed those expected from biological temperature
              relationships established more than 100 years ago by Arrhenius.
              These increases in growth resulted in a single ``r-strategist''
              pioneer species (the bryozoan Fenestrulina rugula) dominating
              seabed spatial cover and drove a reduction in overall diversity
              and evenness. In contrast, a 2°C rise produced divergent
              responses across species growth, resulting in higher variability
              in the assemblage. These data extend our ability to expand,
              integrate, and apply our knowledge of the impact of temperature
              on biological processes to predict organism, species, and

               0.25‰ at 95\% confidence) with acceptable sample size
               requirements (1--3 mg of carbonate). A core top calibration of
               several common planktic and two benthic species from

               agreement between the isotopic composition measured by MC-ICPMS

               predicted using the recently measured isotopic equilibrium

               during much of the Holocene and the last interglacial period
               surface water at Site 999A was in equilibrium with the

               Holocene, it was a minor to significant source of CO2 to the
               atmosphere possibly due to either an expansion of the eastern
               equatorial Atlantic upwelling zone, or a more local expansion of
               coastal upwelling in the southern Caribbean. Such reorganisation
               of the oceanic carbonate system in favour of a larger source of
               CO2 to the atmosphere from the equatorial ocean may require

               the North Atlantic Ocean for the past 220 yr is documented here
               from measurements of Pb concentration and isotope ratios from
               annually-banded corals that grew in coastal seawaters near
               Bermuda and from seawater samples collected during the last 20
               yr of the 20th century. Anthropogenic Pb emissions in this area
               have been dominated by the industrialization of North America
               beginning in the 1840s, the introduction of leaded gasoline
               beginning in the 1920s and its phase-out that began in the
               mid-1970s. The phase-out of leaded gasoline was largely
               completed by the late 1990s. Coral Pb concentrations occur at a
               constant low level of about 5 nmol Pb/mol Ca (~15 pmol/kg in
               seawater) from the late 1700s to ~1850. From ~1850 to ~1900
               there is a small increase rising to a plateau at ~25 nmol Pb/mol
               Ca (~80 pmol/kg in seawater) in the 1930s until the late 1940s,
               at which point Pb concentrations rapidly increase to ~60 nmol
               Pb/mol Ca (~200 pmol/kg in seawater). In the mid 1970s, Pb began
               to decline to ~25 nmol Pb/Ca (40 pmol/kg in seawater) by the end
               of the 20th century, comparable to levels occurring in the early
               20th century. Pb isotope ratios (Pb I.R.) show maximum
               206Pb/207Pb=1.21 and 208Pb/207Pb=2.49 in the middle of the 19th
               century. We conclude that this signal is a reflection of the
               early dominance of Upper Mississippi Valley Pb ore in the United
               States, as previously seen in the estuarine sediments of Rhode
               Island. After 1900, Pb I.R. decrease only slightly until the
               1960s when there is a significant local maximum in the 1970s to
               206Pb/207Pb=1.19 and 208Pb/207Pb=2.45 as low-Pb I.R. sources
               were phased out in the United States. Then, as US leaded
               gasoline utilization decreased more rapidly than European Pb gas
               utilization (which has lower Pb I.R.), western North Atlantic Pb
               I.R. decreased to 206Pb/207Pb=1.17 and 208Pb/207Pb=2.44, their
               lowest values in the past two centuries.",

               the proxy of oceanic pH provided by the boron isotope ratio of
               foraminiferal carbonate are relatively well understood, but the
               proxy's reliability has been questioned. We present 76 new
               Multi-Collector Inductively-Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry
               (MC-ICPMS) $\delta$11B measurements on a range of benthic
               foraminifera from 23 late-Holocene samples from the Atlantic
               that reaffirm the utility of the $\delta$11B-pH proxy. Our boron
               isotope measurements on ~10 benthic foraminifera tests typically
               yield a precision of ~$\pm$0.25‰ at 2 s.d. (equivalent to
               ~$\pm$0.03 pH units). $\delta$11B values of epifaunal species
               are within analytical uncertainty of those predicted from a
               simple model assuming sole incorporation of B(OH)4− from
               seawater and no vital effects, using the independently
               determined fractionation factor of 1.0272 between 11B/10B of
               aqueous boron species. Infaunal foraminifera are consistent with
               this model, but record the combined effects of lower pore-water
               $\delta$11B and pH. No influence of partial dissolution or shell
               size on $\delta$11B is observed. We have also measured the B/Ca
               ratios of the same samples. For individual Cibicidoides species,
               B/Ca shows a good correlation with $\Delta$[CO32−], but the B/Ca
               of different co-occurring species morphotypes varies
               considerably. These effects are not seen in $\delta$11B, which
               may therefore provide a more robust proxy of the ocean carbonate
               system. Whilst in theory $\delta$11B and B/Ca can be combined to
               provide a quantitative reconstruction of alkalinity and
               dissolved inorganic carbonate (DIC), in practice this is
               precluded by propagated uncertainties. $\delta$11B data give
               significant constraints on foraminifera calcification
               mechanisms, and seem most simply explained by incorporation of
               B(OH)4− into a HCO3− pool, which is then completely incorporated
               in foraminiferal CaCO3. Our demonstration of the predictable
               variation of $\delta$11B with pH, across a wide range of species
               and locations, provides confidence in the application of
               MC-ICPMS measurements of foraminiferal $\delta$11B to

               modification of pH in the calcifying space by a value that is an
               inverse function of seawater pH. This mechanism partially

               Trotter et al. (2011) for tropical surface corals, the data

              vary in concert with diurnal Mg/Ca banding, forming compositional

              and [CO32−]) within the foraminiferal microenvironment by the net
              effects of photosynthesis, respiration and calcification. The
              amplitude of B/Ca banding broadly conforms to banding predicted
              using the bulk-shell B/Ca sensitivity to the carbonate chemistry
              changes in the foraminiferal microenvironment. U/Ca banding tends
              to be greater than predicted using the published bulk-shell

              the published bulk shell calibration does not accurately reflect
              the U/Ca sensitivity at the micro-scale. A fourfold increase in
              seawater DIC composition (1026 to 4019 $\mu$mol kg−1) is
              associated with significant increases in Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca
              partitioning, and a decrease in Mn/Ca partitioning into shell
              calcite. The accompanying fourfold increase in calcite saturation
              produces only a twofold increase in calcification rate (0.14 to
              0.28, $\pm$0.02 $\mu$m hr−1), suggesting that seawater carbonate
              chemistry exerts only a small effect on foraminiferal
              calcification rates, but does have a significant influence on

               calcite ($\delta$11BCc) provides valuable information on the pH
               of ambient water at the time of calcification. Hence,
               $\delta$11BCc of fossil surface-dwelling planktonic foraminifera
               can be used to reconstruct ancient aqueous pCO2 if information
               on a second carbonate system parameter, temperature and salinity
               is available. However, pH and pCO2 of surface waters may vary
               seasonally, largely due to changes in temperature, DIC, and
               alkalinity. As also the shell fluxes of planktonic foraminifera
               show species-specific seasonal patterns that are linked to
               intra-annual changes in temperature, it is obvious that
               $\delta$11BCc of a certain species reflects the pH and thus pCO2
               biased towards a specific time period within a year. This is
               important to consider for the interpretation of fossil
               $\delta$11BCc records that may mirror seasonal pH signals. Here
               we present new Multi-Collector Inductively Coupled Mass
               Spectrometry (MC-ICPMS) $\delta$11BCc coretop data for the
               planktonic foraminifera species Globigerina bulloides,
               Globigerinoides ruber, Trilobatus sacculifer and Orbulina
               universa and compare them with $\delta$11Bborate derived from
               seasonally resolved carbonate system parameters. We show that
               the inferred season-adjusted $\delta$11BCc/$\delta$11Bborate
               relationships are similar to existing calibrations and can be
               combined with published $\delta$11BCc field and culture data to
               augment paleo-pH calibrations. To test the applicability of
               these calibrations, we used a core drilled on the Walvis Ridge
               in the Southeast Atlantic spanning the last 330,000 years to
               reconstruct changes in surface-water pCO2. The reconstruction
               based on G. bulloides, which reflects the austral spring season,
               was shown to yield values that closely resemble the Vostok
               ice-core data indicating that surface-water pCO2 was close to
               equilibrium with the atmosphere during the cooler spring season.
               In contrast, pCO2 estimated from $\delta$11BCc of O. universa,
               T. sacculifer and G. ruber that predominantly lived during the
               warmer seasons, exhibits up to ∼50 ppmv higher values than the
               Vostok ice-core data. This is probably due to the higher austral
               summer and fall temperatures, as shown by Mg/Ca to be on average
               ∼4 °C higher than during the cooler spring season, accounting
               for an increase in pCO2 of ∼4\% per 1 °C. Our results
               demonstrate that paleo-pH estimates based on $\delta$11BCc
               contain a significant seasonal signal reflecting the habitat
               preference of the recording foraminifera species.",

  abstract = "We investigate the sensitivity of U/Ca, Mg/Ca, and Sr/Ca to
              changes in seawater [CO32−] and temperature in calcite produced
              by the two planktonic foraminifera species, Orbulina universa and
              Globigerina bulloides, in laboratory culture experiments. Our
              results demonstrate that at constant temperature, U/Ca in O.
              universa decreases by 25 $\pm$ 7\% per 100 $\mu$mol [CO32−] kg−1,
              as seawater [CO32−] increases from 110 to 470 $\mu$mol kg−1.
              Results from G. bulloides suggest a similar relationship, but
              U/Ca is consistently offset by ∼+40\% at the same environmental
              [CO32−]. In O. universa, U/Ca is insensitive to temperature
              between 15°C and 25°C. Applying the O. universa relationship to
              three U/Ca records from a related species, Globigerinoides
              sacculifer, we estimate that Caribbean and tropical Atlantic
              [CO32−] was 110 $\pm$ 70 $\mu$mol kg−1 and 80 $\pm$ 40 $\mu$mol
              kg−1 higher, respectively, during the last glacial period
              relative to the Holocene. This result is consistent with
              estimates of the glacial--interglacial change in surface water
              [CO32−] based on both modeling and on boron isotope pH estimates.
              In settings where the addition of U by diagenetic processes is
              not a factor, down-core records of foraminiferal U/Ca have
              potential to provide information about changes in the ocean's
              carbonate concentration. Below ambient pH (pH < 8.2), Mg/Ca
              decreased by 7 $\pm$ 5\% (O. universa) to 16 $\pm$ 6\% (G.
              bulloides) per 0.1 unit increase in pH. Above ambient pH, the
              change in Mg/Ca was not significant for either species. This
              result suggests that Mg/Ca-based paleotemperature estimates for
              the Quaternary, during which surface-ocean pH has been at or
              above modern levels, have not been biased by variations in
              surface-water pH. Sr/Ca increased linearly by 1.6 $\pm$ 0.4\% per
              0.1 unit increase in pH. Shell Mg/Ca increased exponentially with
              temperature in O. universa, where Mg/Ca = 0.85 exp (0.096*T),

               34 water molecules surrounding the solute. HF/6-31G* level
               calculations coupled with a 0.920 scaling factor are used for

               from this study compared to the commonly used 1.0194 (Kakihana

               predict pH values for equilibrium cases such as incorporation

               to be a seawater pH proxy. Nevertheless, the use of $\delta$11B
               has some limitations such as the knowledge of the fractionation
               factor ($\alpha$4-3) between boric acid and the borate ion and
               the amplitude of ``vital effects'' on this proxy that are not
               well constrained. Using secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS)
               we have examined the internal variability of the boron isotope
               ratio in the shallow water, symbionts bearing foraminiferan

               temperature (24$\pm$0.1°C) in seawater with pH ranging between
               7.90 and 8.45. Intra-shell boron isotopes showed large
               variability with an upper limit value of $\approx$30‰. Our
               results suggest that the fractionation factor $\alpha$4-3 of
               0.97352 (Klochko et al., 2006) is in better agreement with our
               experiments and with direct pH measurements in seawater vacuoles
               associated with the biomineralization process in these
               foraminifera. Despite the large variability of the skeletal pH
               values in each cultured specimen, it is possible to link the
               lowest calculated pH values to the experimental culture pH
               values while the upper pH limit is slightly below 9. This
               variability can be interpreted as follows: foraminifera variably
               increase the pH at the biomineralization site to about 9. This
               increase above ambient seawater pH leads to a range in
               $\delta$11B ($\Delta$11B) for each seawater pH. This $\Delta$11B
               is linearly correlated with the culture seawater pH with a slope
               of −13.1 per pH unit, and is independent of the fractionation
               factor $\alpha$4-3, or the $\delta$11Bsw through time. It may
               also be independent of the pKB (the dissociation constant of
               boric acid) value. Therefore, $\Delta$11B in foraminifera can

  abstract  = "Despite the importance of boron as a proxy of past ocean pH, the
               crystal-chemical factors controlling its incorporation in the
               structure of calcium carbonates are still poorly understood.
               This is partly linked to an imperfect knowledge of the
               coordination, protonation state and local environment of boron
               species in these minerals. In the present study, we use
               first-principles quantum mechanical tools to model selected
               trigonal and tetragonal boron species in calcite and aragonite.
               The stable geometry of the models is obtained from standard
               energy minimization schemes or using a more advanced
               metadynamics exploration of their configurational space. The
               computation of 11B NMR chemical shifts and quadrupolar coupling
               parameters enables a straightforward comparison of the models to
               existing experimental NMR data. The results show that B in
               calcium carbonates does occur as structural species substituted
               for CO32− anions. The B speciation depends on the polymorph
               considered. In calcite, structural boron is present as partially
               deprotonated trigonal BO2(OH)2− species coexisting with a
               fraction of substituted B(OH)4− groups. In aragonite, the
               B(OH)4− substitution for CO32− anions is dominant. Different
               species, including entrapped B(OH)3 molecules and substituted
               BO33− groups also occur in biogenic samples. The diversity of B
               speciation reflects a diversity of B incorporation mechanisms
               and sheds light on previous studies confronting B isotopic
               composition determination with NMR observations. The mechanisms
               of boron incorporation in calcium carbonates are probably more
               complex than usually assumed in the literature using boron
               isotopes as a proxy of paleo-atmospheric CO2 reconstructions.
               Although not invalidating the empirical paleo-pH proxy, these
               results call for a better understanding of the fundamental
               mechanisms of boron incorporation in carbonates.",

               the fundamental reactions that govern the incorporation and
               subsequent isotope fractionation of this element in these
               materials. Toward this goal we have investigated boron
               adsorption on the surface of amorphous silica (SiO2·0.32H2O) and
               quantified its isotopic fractionation. Boron adsorption
               envelopes and corresponding isotope fractionation factors were
               measured in dilute aqueous solutions (0.01 M) of NaCl and CaCl2.
               B maximum adsorbed fraction was found to be about 2 times higher
               in CaCl2 solutions than in NaCl. The modelling of chemical and
               isotopic data in NaCl solutions allowed to identify the
               formation of two main B surface species at the SiO2(am)/water
               interface: a neutral trigonal (B3) inner-sphere complex,
               >SiOB(OH)20, characterized by a fractionation factor of ∼ -16 ‰
               relative to aqueous boric acid, and a negatively charged
               tetrahedral (B4) inner-sphere complex, >SiOB(OH)3--, with
               fractionation factors of -5 ‰ with respect to aqueous borate. In
               CaCl2 solutions the data modelling indicates the presence of B4
               inner-sphere complexes with a fractionation factor of -6.5 ‰
               relative to aqueous borate, but excludes the presence of
               trigonal surface species and suggests instead the formation of a
               Ca-B(OH)4-- complex that could partly account for the observed
               increase of boron adsorption in these solutions. These
               observations indicate that changes in the surface charge density
               and interfacial water structure due to different background
               electrolytes can induce changes in concentration and both
               chemical and isotopic composition of B adsorbed on silica
               surfaces. Although this study suggests that the B adsorption
               reaction on SiO2(am) plays a minor role in the B incorporation
               and isotopic signature of clay minerals and siliceous cements
               forming during weathering reactions, the acquired data should
               allow for an improved knowledge of the biomineralization
               reactions. The observed B isotopic fractionations between
               adsorbed and aqueous B species should help determining the
               relative contribution of various processes, such as cellular
               transport, biological mediation and silicification reactions, on
               the amount of B incorporated in siliceous microorganisms and its
               isotopic signatures. In addition, the presence in NaCl solutions
               of both trigonal and tetrahedral boron complexes at the silica
               surface could explain the observed weak pH dependence of the
               boron isotopic composition of marine diatoms.",

  author   = "Adriano, D C and Wenzel, W W and Vangronsveld, J and Bolan, N S",
  abstract = "Metals are common contaminants worldwide. Long-term deposition of
              metals in soils can lead to accumulation, transport and
              biotoxicity/zootoxicity caused by mobility and bioavailability of
              significant fraction of the metals. Contaminant bioavailability
              is increasingly being used as a key indicator of potential risk
              that contaminants pose to both environmental and human health.
              However, the definition of bioavailability and the concepts on
              which it is based are still unclear, the methods adopted for its
              measurement vary and as such there is no single standard
              technique for the assessment of either plant availability of
              contaminants or their ecotoxicological impacts on soil biota.
              Moreover, bioavailability is often assumed to be static in nature
              where most decisions on risk and remediation are based on
              laboratory estimations of the bioavailable fraction, which may
              vary with time, nature of species as well as with temporal
              variation in environmental factors. Because of their immutable
              nature, strict natural attenuation processes alone may not be
              sufficient in mitigating the risks from metals. However,
              accelerating these processes with human interference (i.e.,
              assisted natural remediation) that effectively immobilizes metals
              might be a viable option. Application to soils of certain
              amendments that enhance key biogeochemical processes in soils
              that effectively immobilize metals have already been demonstrated
              in Europe and North America on a field scale. Case studies using
              lime, phosphate and biosolid amendments have demonstrated, under
              field conditions, enhanced natural remediation resulting in
              substantially improved vegetation growth, invigorated microbial
              population and diversity, and reduced offsite metal transport.
              Depending on soil/hydrogeochemical properties, source term and
              metal form/species, and land use, the immobilization efficacy
              induced by such assisted natural remediation may be enduring. The
              use of green plants as a remediation tool in environmental
              cleanup has also offered some potential. Plants can uptake and
              bioaccumulate (phytoextraction) as well as immobilize
              (phytoimmobilization) certain trace elements, in conjunction with
              their rhizospheric processes. While long-term stability of
              certain metal complexes, such as metal pyromorphites has been
              shown in model systems, the influence of plant roots and its
              microbial and mycorrhizal association on such stability is
              unknown. A suite of chemical and biological tests are available
              to monitor the efficacy of assisted natural remediation.",

  abstract = "The chemical composition of bivalve shells can reflect that of
              their environment, making them useful indicators of climate,
              pollution, and ecosystem changes. However, biological factors can
              also influence chemical properties of biogenic carbonate.
              Understanding how these factors affect chemical incorporation is
              essential for studies that use elemental chemistry of carbonates
              as indicators of environmental parameters. This study examined
              the effects of bivalve shell growth rate and age on the
              incorporation of elements into juvenile softshell clams, Mya
              arenaria. Although previous studies have explored the effects of
              these two biological factors, reports have differed depending on
              species and environmental conditions. In addition, none of the
              previous studies have examined growth rate and age in the same
              species and within the same study. We reared clams in controlled
              laboratory conditions and used solution-based inductively coupled
              plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis to explore whether
              growth rate affects elemental incorporation into shell. Growth
              rate was negatively correlated with Mg, Mn, and Ba shell
              concentration, possibly due to increased discrimination ability
              with size. The relationship between growth rate and Pb and Sr was
              unresolved. To determine age effects on incorporation, we used
              laser ablation ICP-MS to measure changes in chemical composition
              across shells of individual clams. Age affected incorporation of
              Mn, Sr, and Ba within the juvenile shell, primarily due to
              significantly different elemental composition of early shell
              material compared to shell accreted later in life. Variability in
              shell composition increased closer to the umbo (hinge), which may
              be the result of methodology or may indicate an increased ability
              with age to discriminate against ions that are not calcium or
              carbonate. The effects of age and growth rate on elemental
              incorporation have the potential to bias data interpretation and

              relative importance of different ecological and environmental
              factors. A performance measure that has previously been used as
              an indicator of thermal capacity of the Antarctic limpet (Nacella
              concinna) to cope with regional warming is the ability to right
              if removed from the substratum and turned upside down. As part of
              an on-going study into limpet genetics and phenotypic plasticity,
              we tested the temperature limits for 50\% righting of limpets
              from 6 and 30m depth. The 50\% threshold for limpets collected
              from 6m (4.7°C) was higher than for those collected from 30m
              (0.7°C). This compares with a previously published limit of 2.2°C
              for limpets collected from 12--15m at the same location. These
              thermal limits positively correlated with a depth gradient in

              requirements of flat limpets, which have to turn through a
              greater angle to right than tall limpets. Of the factors that
              cause morphological plasticity of gastropod shells, iceberg
              disturbance is the most likely cause of the sub-tidal gradient in
              N. concinna shell shape, and therefore the thermal limit for

               simultaneous high rates of photosynthesis and calcification
               during daylight hours. Also, the extreme metabolic activity
               observed in corals at high irradiance requires a large net
               efflux of protons at sites of rapid calcification and
               respiration. Corals have resolved these problems through
               development of morphologies that separate the zone of rapid
               calcification (ZC) from the zone of rapid photosynthesis (ZP),
               with the fixed-carbon energy supply from the ZP being rapidly
               translocated to the ZC. Translocation of photosynthate from the
               ZP serves as a means of transporting protons to the ZC, where
               they are readily dissipated into the water column. Observations
               on the spatial relationship of the ZC and ZP, analysis of net
               proton flux, incorporation of photosynthate translocation
               coupled with an understanding of the importance of boundary
               layers (BL) leads to a unified hypothesis that describes the
               processes involved in coral metabolism. The proposed model is
               based on the observation that reef corals have evolved a wide
               range of morphologies, but all of them place the ZC between the
               ZP and the external seawater. This spatial arrangement places
               the BL in contact with the ZC in order to facilitate efflux of
               protons out of the corallum. Placement of the ZC between the ZP
               and the BL maximizes recycling of the metabolic products O2 and
               HCO3−. Furthermore, this arrangement maximizes the
               photosynthetic efficiency of zooxanthellae by producing a canopy
               structure with the skeletal material in the ZC serving to absorb
               ultraviolet radiation (UVR) while scattering photosynthetically
               active radiation (PAR) in a manner that maximizes absorption by
               the zooxanthellae. The ZP is isolated from the water column by
               the ZC and the BL. Therefore ZP must exchange metabolic
               materials with the ZC and with the water column through the ZC
               and its overlying BL. The resulting configuration is highly
               efficient and responsive to irradiance direction, irradiance
               intensity, water motion and coral polyp morphology. The
               skeletons of corals are thereby passively modified in response
               to physical factors such as light and water motion regime. The
               model presents a unified theory of coral metabolism and provides
               explanations for many paradoxes of coral biology, including

              window and within constant temperatures: Experimental study on an
              intertidal gastropod Monetaria annulus",
  author   = "Irie, Takahiro and Morimoto, Naoko",
  abstract = "The relationship between temperature and shell growth was
              examined by rearing an intertidal cowrie species, Monetaria
              annulus (Gastropoda, Cypraeidae), at seven constant temperatures
              between 21°C and 34°C over four experimental years. Data on shell
              growth were collected during the callus-building stage, in which
              calcification exclusively occurs around the spiral shell
              constructed in the juvenile stage. Our experiments elucidated
              some clear trends among temperatures, although careful
              consideration is required to interpret the results obtained under
              the potential confounding factors between temperature and
              experimental year. Calcification was accelerated by increasing
              temperature in the range between 21°C and 33°C, and drastically
              slowed down at 34°C probably due to heat stress. No relationship
              was found between body size and callus growth rates. The duration
              of callus-building indicated a negative exponential relationship
              with rearing temperature. However, no simple relationship was
              found between temperature and final shell thickness; the final
              shell thickness described two peaks around 21°C and 30°C. This
              finding strongly suggests that a physiological control by
              calcifiers cannot be ignored to explain the thermal response of
              calcification rates. Our results also suggest that considering
              the thermal seasonality as well as the difference in mean
              temperature, is required to explain the negative latitudinal
              clines in shell thickness frequently observed in molluscan
              species. We also focused on the variation among the individuals
              reared at the same temperatures. Statistical analyses suggested
              that the final shell thickness and the duration of calcification
              were better described by the normal and lognormal distributions,
              respectively. The distribution of shell growth rates did not
              considerably deviate from the normal distribution with respect to
              skewness and kurtosis. However, their heteroscedasticity among
              temperatures was inherent and significant; its variance
              positively depended not on the mean but on temperature. The
              observed pattern might be an evidence that possible stabilization
              selection on calcification rates is more relaxed at warmer
              temperatures.",

              of climate change on intertidal ectotherms is the role of
              individual behaviour. In this synthesis, using littorinid snails
              as a case study, we show how thermoregulatory behaviours may
              buffer changes in environmental temperatures. These behaviours
              include either a flight response, to escape the most extreme
              conditions and utilize warmer or cooler environments; or a fight
              response, where individuals modify their own environments to
              minimize thermal extremes. A conceptual model, generated from
              studies of littorinid snails, shows that various flight and fight
              thermoregulatory behaviours may allow an individual to widen its
              thermal safety margin (TSM) under warming or cooling
              environmental conditions and hence increase species' resilience
              to climate change. Thermoregulatory behaviours may also buffer
              sublethal fitness impacts associated with thermal stresses.
              Through this synthesis, we emphasize that future studies need to
              consider not only animals' physiological limits but also their
              capacities to buffer the impact of climate change through
              behavioural responses. Current generalizations, made largely on

              itself are presented, discussed and compared to comparable
              long-term studies. For most of those pollutants atmospheric and
              aquatic emission data are available from 1985 onward. Earliest
              studies about pollutants in the Scheldt Estuary go back to 1978
              and the general trend observed for their concentrations in the
              estuary agrees fairly well with the evolution of their emissions.
              Until the end of the nineties trace metal concentrations
              decreased at the fluvial and marine end-members of the estuary.
              However, recent surveys indicate that the dissolved trace metal
              concentrations particularly in the estuary increased again, while
              their emissions did not. No historical data about PCDD/Fs'
              concentrations in the Scheldt River Basin and the Belgian Coastal
              Zone are available. However, the time trend of the PCDD/F
              concentrations in human milk corroborates their atmospheric
              emission reductions. The particulate trace metal concentrations
              in the Belgian Coastal Zone and in the mouth of the Scheldt
              Estuary follow the same trend. Nevertheless, Scheldt estuarine
              inputs to the Greater North Sea decrease slower than those of
              other estuaries. In sediments of the Upper Scheldt River, a clear
              decrease for Cd, Pb and Zn, but not for Cu was observed between
              1980 and 2007. Also PAH concentrations in those sediments are not
              decreasing during the last 10years. A time lag exists between the
              moment that a reduction in the emission of a given pollutant is
              realized and the decrease of its concentration in the receiving
              aquatic environment.",

              marine organisms can potentially adapt to future projected global
              climate change. Mytilus edulis is an economically important
              marine calcifier vulnerable to decreasing carbonate saturation as
              their shells comprise two calcium carbonate polymorphs: aragonite
              and calcite. M. edulis specimens were cultured under current and
              projected pCO2 (380, 550, 750 and 1000$\mu$atm), following
              6months of experimental culture, adults produced second
              generation juvenile mussels. Juvenile mussel shells were examined
              for structural and crystallographic orientation of aragonite and
              calcite. At 1000$\mu$atm pCO2, juvenile mussels spawned and grown
              under this high pCO2 do not produce aragonite which is more
              vulnerable to carbonate under-saturation than calcite. Calcite
              and aragonite were produced at 380, 550 and 750$\mu$atm pCO2.
              Electron back scatter diffraction analyses reveal less constraint
              in crystallographic orientation with increased pCO2. Shell
              formation is maintained, although the nacre crystals appear
              corroded and crystals are not so closely layered together. The
              differences in ultrastructure and crystallography in shells

              shells provide protection against predation, desiccation, and
              disease. Not all species show the same responses to OA, which may
              be due to the composition and microstructural arrangement of
              their shells. We explore the role of shell composition and
              microstructure in resisting dissolution caused by decreases in
              seawater pH using a combination of microCT scans, XRD analysis,
              and SEM imaging. Two gastropods with different shell compositions

              exposed to simulated ocean acidification conditions for six
              months. Both species showed signs of dissolution on the exterior

              pronounced in T. funebralis. XRD analysis indicated that the
              exterior layer of both shell types was made of calcite. T.
              funebralis may be more prone to dissolution because their outer

              potentially increasing the surface area on which dissolution can
              occur. These results support a previous study where T. funebralis
              showed significant decreases in both shell growth and strength,
              but N. ostrina only showed slight reductions in shell strength,

              the biotic responses, actual or potential, to that change. There
              is also great concern over biodiversity and the observed losses
              to date. However, there has been little focus on the diversity of
              potential responses that organisms can make, and how this would
              influence both the focus of investigation and conservation
              efforts. Here emphasis is given to broad scale approaches, from
              gene to ecosystem and where a better understanding of diversity
              of potential response is needed. There is a need for the
              identification of rare, key or unique genomes and physiologies
              that should be made priorities for conservation because of their
              importance to global biodiversity. The new discipline of
              conservation physiology is one aspect of the many ways in which
              organismal responses to environmental variability and change can
              be investigated, but wider approaches are needed. Environmental
              change, whether natural or human induced occurs over a very wide
              range of scales, from nanometres to global and seconds to
              millennia. The processes involved in responses also function over
              a wide range of scales, from the molecular to the ecosystem.
              Organismal responses to change should be viewed in these wider
              frameworks. Within this overall framework the rate of change of
              an environmental variable dictates which biological process will
              be most important in the success or failure of the response.
              Taking this approach allows an equation to be formulated that

               paleoceanographic interpretations based on them. Here, we
               present a combined genetic and biometric analysis of Orbulina
               universa specimens in the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans.
               Our study is based on shells retained after DNA extractions. On
               those genotyped shells, we perform biometric analyses (shell
               size and thickness, inner porosity and pore surface
               distribution). Our genetic data confirm the presence of three
               cryptic species of O. universa in the world ocean, whose
               distributions are primarily correlated to the productivity of
               the surface waters. The Mediterranean species of O. universa is
               most abundant in the vertically mixed and nutrient-rich areas of
               the low to mid-latitudes, whereas the Caribbean and Sargasso
               species occur in stratified and oligotrophic subtropical waters.
               Our biometric data show no correlation between shell size and
               inner porosity within each cryptic species of O. universa.
               Combining Principal Component Analyses with MANOVAs performed on
               shell pore surface distribution, we demonstrate that the three
               different cryptic species are characterized by significant
               morphological differentiation. The Caribbean species typically
               exhibits large pores and higher porosity values, while the
               Mediterranean and Sargasso species are characterized by smaller
               pore areas and shell porosity. A model based upon pore surface
               distribution correctly assigns 60\% to 90\% of the specimens to
               their corresponding genotype. Although the inner shell surface
               of the Sargasso species resembles that of the Mediterranean
               species, our model demonstrates that the pore surface
               distributions of these two cryptic species can be distinguished.
               Finally, the Sargasso species exhibits significantly thinner
               shells than the two other cryptic species.",

               is comparable to the Type III Mediterranean genotype. The flux
               of Mthick increases during periods of upwelling, whereas Mthin
               flux shows no systematic relationship with changing hydrographic
               regimes in the basin. The $\delta$18O and $\delta$13C of Mthick
               are on average 0.34‰ higher and 0.38‰ lower, respectively, than
               those of Mthin, suggesting that they calcify their final
               spherical chamber at different depths in the water column and/or
               differ in their vital effects on shell geochemistry.
               Additionally, the absolute offset in the stable isotopic
               compositions of the two morphotypes varies as a function of
               surface ocean stratification. During periods of upwelling, the
               $\delta$18O and $\delta$13C absolute offsets between Mthin and
               Mthick are on average −0.15 and 0.25‰, whereas average
               $\delta$18O and $\delta$13C absolute offsets between these two
               morphotypes increase to −0.54 and 0.41‰ during non-upwelling
               periods. We attribute the higher $\delta$18O and $\delta$13C
               offsets during non-upwelling periods to a difference in final
               chamber calcification depth and the combined effects of
               temperature ($\delta$18O), $\delta$13CDIC ($\delta$13C),
               irradiance ($\delta$13C) and [CO32−] ($\delta$18O and
               $\delta$13C). These data provide field evidence that thin and
               thick morphotypes of O. universa likely experience different
               environmental conditions during the formation of their final
               chamber and, therefore, should not be combined in geochemical
               analyses for reconstructing past surface ocean conditions.
               Finally, we introduce a new proxy for reconstructing past
               surface ocean stratification changes via the use of Mthin and
               Mthick $\delta$18O and $\delta$13C offsets.",

              ocean. Despite this importance, the main functions of
              foraminifera's test and ornamentation such as spines are unclear.
              Spinose species dominate the planktonic foraminifera population
              in subtropical oligotrophic gyres, while non-spinose species
              dominate in deeper waters and at high latitudes suggesting that
              spines help foraminifera in food-limited areas. Here we take a
              novel approach to investigate the benefits of spines on
              foraminifera foraging using a 0-D trait-based ecosystem model.
              The model considers the traits of size, calcification, spines,
              passive feeding, and diet. We assess how the presence of spines
              impact foraminifera diet and fitness via a series of simulated
              environments representing oligo, meso- and eutrophic settings at
              different temperatures. We find that independent of diet,
              non-spinose taxa need to be more size-generalist predators than
              other zooplankton species to maintain their population. In
              contrast, spinose species benefit from a relatively higher
              surface-to-volume ratio compared to non-spinose species, which
              allows them to be as generalist as other zooplankton groups. In
              agreement with observations, we find that herbivory is the most
              successful diet in cold environments, while carnivory allows
              foraminifera to be more successful in warm environments.",

              of lead pollution. Previous studies have stressed that shells
              display little variability compared to soft tissues and thus are
              better for pollution biomonitoring. However, in this manuscript
              we illustrate that there is large inter- and intra-annual Pb
              variability between shells of the clam Mercenaria mercenaria
              collected in North Carolina, USA. Therefore, year to year, as
              well as intra-annual variations in Pb/Ca ratios should be
              interpreted with caution. Despite this variability, we were able
              to obtain an annual Pb chronology from 1949 to 2002 using 11
              shells collected at different times which clearly exhibited the
              late 1970's peak in Pb from leaded gasoline use. This indicates
              that when enough specimens are pooled together, bivalve shells
              can be used to reconstruct large, long term changes in
              environmental Pb concentrations. Our data compare well with other
              studies of aragonite clams from sites with low regional lead
              pollution. From this we conclude that the Cape Lookout region of
              North Carolina has not received extensive pollution over the
              1949-2002 period. The Pb concentration in shells growing in the
              1949-1976 period was not significantly different from those
              growing in the 1982-2002 period, although other proxies suggest
              that the 1949-1976 period should be considerably higher.
              Therefore, our data suggest that there is still a modern
              low-level source of Pb in the coastal North Carolina environment.",

              numerical algorithms for time-stepping and mode-splitting
              suitable for a high-resolution, free-surface, terrain-following
              coordinate oceanic model. Due to mathematical feedback between
              the baroclinic momentum and tracer equations and, similarly,
              between the barotropic momentum and continuity equations, it is
              advantageous to treat both modes so that, after a time step for
              the momentum equation, the computed velocities participate
              immediately in the computation of tracers and continuity, and
              vice versa, rather than advancing all equations for one time step
              simultaneously. This leads to a new family of time-stepping
              algorithms that combine forward--backward feedback with the best
              known synchronous algorithms, allowing an increased time step due
              to the enhanced internal stability without sacrificing its
              accuracy. Based on these algorithms we design a split-explicit
              hydrodynamic kernel for a realistic oceanic model, which
              addresses multiple numerical issues associated with mode
              splitting. This kernel utilizes consistent temporal averaging of
              the barotropic mode via a specially designed filter function to
              guarantee both exact conservation and constancy preservation
              properties for tracers and yields more accurate (up to

              aliasing of unresolved barotropic signals into the slow
              baroclinic motions. It has a more accurate mode-splitting due to
              redefined barotropic pressure-gradient terms to account for the
              local variations in density field, while maintaining the
              computational efficiency of a split model. It is naturally

               sea surface temperatures are significant at the 95\% confidence
               level, they are low (r~0.2), indicating that a more complex
               combination of environmental forcings is driving growth.
               Remarkable longevities of individual animals are apparent in the
               increment-width series used in the chronology, with several

              (EF) and geoaccumulation index (Igeo) were applied to assess the
              enrichment status of heavy metals. Average EF and Igeo values
              indicated that the studied heavy metals in the sediments mainly
              originated from non-point source pollution and soil-water
              erosion, showing low ecological risks. In addition, correlation
              analysis and principal component analysis (PCA) identified that
              Cd, Zn, and P were mainly from agricultural diffusion pollution
              caused by utilization of the phosphate fertilizer; Zn, Ni, and Cr
              originated from soil erosion. PCA analysis was further conducted
              to investigate the relationships among meteorological factors,
              algae-dominant total organic carbon (TOC), and heavy metals.
              Results showed that algae-dominant TOC had strong positive
              correlation with temperature, which can be explained by that
              increased temperature accelerated the growth of algae. Meanwhile
              the opposite loadings between algae-dominant TOC and heavy metal
              suggested that primary production played an important role in
              migration and transformation of metals. Moreover, stepwise
              multiple regression models showed that Fe was sensitive to
              temperature, which accounted for approximately 39.0\% and 40.1\%
              of the variations in Fe of two sediment cores, respectively. Fe
              showed significant decreasing trends during the past 50years.
              Reductive environment of water-sediment interface caused by
              increasing temperature probably contributed to the restoration of
              ferric iron, resulting in the release of soluble Fe to overlying
              waters. Future climate change with elevated temperature and
              extreme weather events will aggravate the ecological risk of

               physiological adaptability of marine calcifiers to the
               near-future ocean acidification and warming; i.e. how
               physiological energetics (respiration rate, feeding rate, energy

               Comparative structural analysis revealed that shells from the

  abstract = "The biogeochemical behavior of Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni and Pb along
              the historically polluted Scheldt estuary (Belgium - The
              Netherlands) was investigated in this study. As never studied
              before in this area, labile trace metals were measured using the
              passive sampling technique of Diffusive Gradients in Thin-films
              (DGT), while total dissolved and particulate trace metal
              concentrations were assessed using classic active sampling
              techniques. This dual approach allowed us to highlight the
              variations of trace metal speciation and distribution in the
              estuarine surface waters, considering environmental and
              physicochemical gradients along the transect. The large data set
              obtained was then compared with literature data of historical
              measurements along the Scheldt (from 1980 until now), but also
              from other estuaries. As emphasized by our results, trace metal
              mobility and partitioning along the Scheldt estuary was mainly
              driven by biogeochemical reactions which were strongly influenced
              by gradients of specific estuarine physico-chemical parameters,
              such as salinity, turbidity, temperature and so on. Hence, all
              species of trace metals displayed a non-conservative behavior.
              More precisely, dissolved labile fractions of trace metals showed
              higher levels in the middle estuary, where many solubilization
              and remobilization processes occurred due to turbulent mixing
              mechanisms and an increasing salinity. Our study confirmed the
              decreasing trend historically observed for particulate metals
              along the Scheldt, as well as the rising concentrations recorded
              for dissolved trace metals which might also lead to an increase
              of their labile fraction measured by the DGT. Finally, these
              preliminary results suggested that a more regular monitoring of
              labile metal along the Scheldt estuary is essential to have an
              in-depth understanding of trace metal speciation and to review
              bioavailability of trace metals within estuarine ecosystems.",

  abstract = "The Arctic is experiencing particularly rapid rates of warming,
              consequently invasive boreal species are now able to survive the
              less extreme Arctic winter temperatures. Whilst persistence of
              intertidal and terrestrial species in the Arctic is primarily
              determined by their ability to tolerate the freezing winters, air
              temperatures in the Arctic summer can reach 36 °C in the
              intertidal, which is beyond the upper thermal limits of many
              marine species. This is normally lethal for the conspicuous
              ecosystem engineer Mytilus edulis. Transcriptomic analyses were
              undertaken on both in situ collected and experimentally warmed
              animals to understand whether M. edulis is able to tolerate these
              very high summer temperatures. Surprisingly there was no
              significant enrichment for Gene Ontology terms (GO) when
              comparing the inner and outer fjord intertidal animals with outer
              fjord subtidal (control) animals, representing animals collected
              at 27 °C, 19 °C and 3 °C respectively. This lack of
              differentiation indicated a wide acclimation ability in this
              species. Conversely, significant enrichment for processes such as
              signal transduction, cytoskeleton and cellular protein
              modification was identified in the expression profiles of the 22
              °C and 32 °C experimentally heated animals. This difference in
              gene expression between in situ collected and experimentally
              warmed animals was almost certainly due to the former being
              acclimated to a fluctuating, but predictable, temperature regime,
              which has increased their thermal tolerances. Interestingly,
              there was no evidence for enrichment of the classical cellular
              stress response in any of the animals sampled. Identification of
              a massive expansion of the HSPA12 heat shock protein 70 kDa gene
              family presented the possibility of these genes acting as
              intertidal regulators underpinning thermal resilience. This
              expansion has resulted in a modified cellular stress response, as
              an evolutionary adaptation to the rigour of the invasive
              intertidal life style. Thus, M. edulis appear to have
              considerable capacity to withstand the current rates of Arctic
              warming, and the very large attendant thermal variation.",

               relationship. This suggests that the bioavailability of these
               metals has decreased over the last few years at the head of the
               fjord, which agrees generally with water chemistry data
               available from the State Pollution Monitoring Programme
               (Norway). The decrease in metal bioavailability could be a
               direct consequence of the 1992 remedial action taken in the
               fjord to reduce heavy metal release from the contaminated
               sediments. Lead concentrations in the skeletons of large
               asteroids (12--14cm; 154 $\pm$ 63 $\mu$g Pb g−1 dry wt) were
               eight times higher than those in the skeletons of juvenile
               individuals (0.5--4 cm; 19 $\pm$ 8 $\mu$g Pb g−1 dry wt) in the
               population located at the head of the fjord. Asteroids of 12--14
               cm length were likely to be 4--7 y old (i.e. born before the
               remedial action) while small asteroids were born after the
               remedial action. According to comparisons with allometric
               relationships in an uncontaminated population and experimental
               exposures, results indicate that the half-life of Pb in the
               skeleton is long (i.e. several years) while the half-life of Cd
               and Zn is much shorter (i.e. several weeks for Cd, and short but
               not precisely known for Zn). A smaller size and unusual
               reduction of the skeleton of adult individuals at the head of
               the fjord were observed and may result from the effects of heavy
               metal pollution. A comparison between possible sources of
               contamination in the fjord (metals in water, food, and
               sediments) indicates that sediment-associated metals are likely
               to be an important source of contamination in this environment
               due to the microphagic activity of asteroids.",

              nine ideas exist regarding how plasticity may be costly or
              limited, but these have rarely been discussed together. The most
              commonly discussed cost is that of maintaining the sensory and

              energy and material expenses. A frequently considered limit to

              recently been included in theoretical models and, perhaps more

               contaminants. Up to 96\% of the areas that were affected by
               sediment disposal (ca. 120 ha) was found to be polluted by at
               least one of the metals Cd, Cr, Zn or Pb. Concentrations of Cd,

               In terms of inferred pH, the lower boron isotope values

               of rainbow trout Salmo gairdneri held in sea cages were

               been monitored monthly (Myers, Cross \& Southgate, 1978, 1979).
               At each site a permanently marked transect is monitored, limpet
               shell lengths are measured in marked quadrats at M.H.W.N.,

               Discoloration of the water was observed at all five monitoring

               early November. During this period mortalities of shore fauna
               were observed at four of the regular sampling sites. Highest
               mortalities were observed at Pointabulloge in Dunmanus Bay. When
               visited on 8 September many Patella spp. on the transect were
               either dead or, if alive, could easily be removed. An estimated

               been progressively restricted, and to quantify the extent of
               imposex impact on the populations present. We surveyed from
               Poole to Selsey where isolated populations had become extinct,
               and the Isle of Wight where some populations had persisted. We
               found evidence that since TBT restrictions, recolonization and
               colonization by N. lapillus has been rapid. By 2007--2008, of
               the eleven surveyed mainland sites, seven were colonized,
               although indications of reduced imposex impacts were mixed.
               Distribution had also extended on the Isle of Wight and
               populations were larger with less imposex impact in sites with
               long term populations. The lack of continuous suitable habitat
               blocks and the hydrodynamic complexity of the region, leads us
               to hypothesize that recovery has been facilitated by man-made
               structures which may be acting as `stepping stones'. Populations
               that have become established on engineered structures such as

               to ports were either not recolonized or had small populations

               way, for the first time, the drilling behaviour of dogwhelks was
               analysed in detail. Radular activity was similar to that
               previously recorded for limpets, each radular stroke (rasp)
               being formed by a sequence of 1--8 unit events, each probably
               corresponding to the application of one row of radular teeth on
               the substratum. During drilling, radular rasping followed a
               consistent pattern, each bout of radular rasping (lasting about
               6--8 min) being followed by a period of radular inactivity
               (lasting about 35 min), when chemical dissolution is probably
               applied. The periodicity with which rasping was applied
               decreased during the drilling sequence (from about 25 min in the
               first quarter of the drilling process to about 40 min in the

               i.e. number of radular rasps per min (from about 12 to about
               five rasps per min). Accordingly, the total number of radular
               rasps recorded during the first quarter of the drilling time was
               higher than during the other quarters (from about 3000 to about
               500 rasps). The role of the radula in shell penetration was
               therefore rather extensive, accounting, during the first quarter
               of the process, for about 34\% of drilling time. The results are

               amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC), and intracrystalline organics

               this interplay in the spines and test plates of the
               Paracentrotus lividus sea urchins. Thermogravimetric analysis
               coupled with differential scanning calorimetry or mass
               spectrometry measurements, nuclear magnetic resonance technique,
               and high-resolution powder X-ray diffraction show that pristine
               spines and test plates are composed of Mg-rich calcite and
               comprise about 1.2 to 1.6 wt \% organics, 10 wt \% of anhydrous
               ACC and less than 0.2 wt \% of water. Anhydrous ACC originates
               from incomplete crystallization of a precursor ACC phase during
               biomineralization and is associated with intracrystalline
               organics at the molecular level. Molecular interactions at
               organic/inorganic interfaces cause calcite lattice distortions
               of the tensile type. The latter are amplified during ACC
               crystallization and finally disappear after heat-assisted
               destruction of organic molecules. Converting the measured
               lattice distortions (strains) into internal stress components,
               we follow stress evolution upon annealing and find that complete
               crystallization of ACC leads to the isotropy of residual
               stresses in all investigated skeletal parts. These results allow

  abstract = "Calcifying organisms are considered particularly susceptible to
              the future impacts of ocean acidification (OA), but recent
              evidence suggests that they may be able to maintain calcification
              and overall fitness. The underlying mechanism remains unclear but
              may be attributed to mineralogical plasticity, which modifies the
              energetic cost of calcification. To test the hypothesis that
              mineralogical plasticity enables the maintenance of shell growth
              and functionality under OA conditions, we assessed the biological
              performance of a gastropod (respiration rate, feeding rate,
              somatic growth, and shell growth of Austrocochlea constricta) and
              analyzed its shell mechanical and geochemical properties (shell
              hardness, elastic modulus, amorphous calcium carbonate, calcite
              to aragonite ratio, and magnesium to calcium ratio). Despite
              minor metabolic depression and no increase in feeding rate, shell
              growth was faster under OA conditions, probably due to increased
              precipitation of calcite and trade-offs against inner shell
              density. In addition, the resulting shell was functionally
              suitable for increasingly ``corrosive'' oceans, i.e., harder and
              less soluble shells. We conclude that mineralogical plasticity
              may act as a compensatory mechanism to maintain overall
              performance of calcifying organisms under OA conditions and could
              be a cornerstone of calcifying organisms to acclimate to and

              adaptation can be achieved. Marine calcifiers are particularly
              vulnerable to ocean acidification due to dissolution and a
              reduction in shell-building carbonate ions. Long-term experiments
              assess organisms' abilities to acclimatize or even adapt to
              environmental change. Here we present an unexpected compensatory
              response to extensive shell dissolution in a highly
              calcium-carbonate-dependent organism after long-term culture in
              predicted end-century acidification and warming conditions.
              Substantial shell dissolution with decreasing pH posed a threat
              to both a polar ( Liothyrella uva) and a temperate ( Calloria
              inconspicua) brachiopod after 7 months and 3 months exposure,
              respectively, with more extensive dissolution in the polar
              species. This impact was reflected in decreased outer primary
              layer thickness in the polar brachiopod. A compensatory response
              of increasing inner secondary layer thickness, and thereby
              producing a thicker shell, was exhibited by the polar species.
              Less extensive dissolution in the temperate brachiopod did not
              affect shell thickness. Increased temperature did not impact
              shell dissolution or thickness. Brachiopod ability to produce a

               microscopy. The growth lines consist of a blocklike
               microstructure and a spherulitic microstructure, separated by a

               aragonite, the same CaCO3 polymorph as in the nacreous
               microstructure in these shells. The spherulitic structure is
               composed of radially distributed elongated crystals, whereas the
               blocklike structure involves crystalline aggregates with
               irregular shape. The individual aggregates are approximately
               single crystal, with orientations identical to that of the
               adjacent stack of tablets in the nacreous structure. The
               interfaces defining the transition from nacreous to blocklike
               microstructures are abrupt; on the other hand, the transition
               from spherulitic to nacreous microstructures shows more
               irregularity because of the occasional intergrowth of elongated
               crystals into the nacreous region. The microstructures of ``flat
               pearls'', produced by mineralization of an abiotic substrate (a
               glass cover slip) inserted between the mantle tissue and the
               growing edge of the shell in a live abalone, have also been
               studied. A thin calcitic CaCO3 layer is produced on the center
               of the glass substrate, which is soon covered by green organic
               matrix. This matrix extends beyond the calcitic region; that is,
               it can be secreted directly onto the glass. Mineralization of
               this green matrix layer involves the deposition of spherulitic
               aragonite, similar to that occurring in the native shell, which
               is then capped by nacreous aragonite. Thus, the microstructures

              compared to controls (0.19-0.39 microg g(-1)). This increase
              corresponded to an elevation in the proportion of Cd associated
              with the metallothionein-like proteins (MTLPs) in the mussels,
              suggesting that exposure to Cd and subsequent induction of MTLPs

              elevated body concentrations following 7-d exposure to 250 microg
              L(-1), although Zn and Cd uptake from the dissolved phase were
              reduced by 24-47\% by exposure to a lower concentration (100
              microg L(-1)) for 7 and 21 d. Despite the lack of an increase in

              subcellular distribution of metals in affecting the biokinetics

              further increasing the body burdens. In contrast, preexposure to
              Zn has a negative effect on Cd and Zn influx from the dissolved
              phase, suggesting the mechanism of Zn regulation but also
              potentially reducing Cd uptake and body concentrations over the
              long-term exposure. Such effects may have implications for
              biomonitoring studies involving a single species that modifies
              physiological processes affecting metal uptake (and hence

              biomineral that contains crystalline aragonite tablets confined
              by organic layers. Nacre is intensely studied because its
              biologically controlled microarchitecture gives rise to
              remarkable strength and toughness, but the mechanisms leading to
              its formation are not well understood. Here we present
              synchrotron spectromicroscopy experiments revealing that stacks
              of aragonite tablet crystals in nacre are misoriented with
              respect to each other. Quantitative measurements of crystal
              orientation, tablet size, and tablet stacking direction show that
              orientational ordering occurs not abruptly but gradually over a
              distance of 50 microm. Several lines of evidence indicate that
              different crystal orientations imply different tablet growth
              rates during nacre formation. A theoretical model based on
              kinetic and gradual selection of the fastest growth rates
              produces results in qualitative and quantitative agreement with
              the experimental data and therefore demonstrates that ordering in
              nacre is a result of crystal growth kinetics and competition
              either in addition or to the exclusion of templation by acidic
              proteins as previously assumed. As in other natural evolving
              kinetic systems, selection of the fastest-growing stacks of
              tablets occurs gradually in space and time. These results suggest
              that the self-ordering of the mineral phase, which may occur
              completely independently of biological or organic-molecule
              control, is fundamental in nacre formation.",

               In contrast to previous interpretations we suggest that these

               compositionally distinct gametogenic calcite in small
               individuals compared to larger ones. As with $\delta$11B this

               orthogonal function (EOF) analysis revealed 3 modes of
               variability that explained 89\% of the variance in the
               productivity data set. The first mode, strongest during spring,
               describes seasonal productivity changes driven by coastal
               upwelling. The second mode, largest in spring and fall,
               describes productivity changes over the western SBC associated
               with cyclonic eddies. Eddy-enhanced productivity changes were
               superimposed on variable levels of channel-wide productivity
               caused by upwelling within the SBC. The cyclonic eddies
               influenced productivity through enhanced nutrient supply
               associated with the uplift of isopycnal surfaces and through the
               occasional entrainment of phytoplankton and nutrients from water

  abstract  = "Abstract Coastal upwelling is responsible for thriving marine
               ecosystems and fisheries that are disproportionately productive
               relative to their surface area, particularly in the world's
               major eastern boundary upwelling systems. Along oceanic eastern
               boundaries, equatorward wind stress and the Earth's rotation
               combine to drive a near-surface layer of water offshore, a
               process called Ekman transport. Similarly, positive wind stress
               curl drives divergence in the surface Ekman layer and
               consequently upwelling from below, a process known as Ekman
               suction. In both cases, displaced water is replaced by upwelling
               of relatively nutrient-rich water from below, which stimulates
               the growth of microscopic phytoplankton that form the base of
               the marine food web. Ekman theory is foundational and underlies
               the calculation of upwelling indices such as the ?Bakun Index?
               that are ubiquitous in eastern boundary upwelling system
               studies. While generally valuable first-order descriptions,
               these indices and their underlying theory provide an incomplete
               picture of coastal upwelling. Here we review the relevant
               dynamics and limitations of classical upwelling indices,
               particularly related to representation of the surface wind
               stress, the influence of geostrophic currents, and the
               properties of upwelled water. To address these shortcomings, we
               present two new upwelling indices for the U.S. West Coast
               (31?47°N), which are available from 1988 to present. The Coastal
               Upwelling Transport Index and the Biologically Effective

               transport and vertical nitrate flux, respectively, by leveraging

               measurements of planktic foraminifera, paleoceanographically
               important zooplankton, from the nutrient-rich waters of the
               modern Southern Ocean. Foraminifera were collected from net tows
               in the Subantarctic and Polar Frontal Zones (SAZ and PFZ,
               respectively) south of Africa during winter 2015 and late summer
               2016. In late summer, consistent with preferential uptake of
               14N-nitrate and the progressive, northward depletion of nitrate
               by phytoplankton across the Southern Ocean, foraminifer tissue
               and shell-bound $\delta$15N rise equatorward along with nitrate
               $\delta$15N. However, foraminifer $\delta$15N is ~3? lower than
               expected for heterotrophs relying on photosynthetic biomass
               generated directly from nitrate. This discrepancy appears to
               originate with the particulate organic N (PON) in late-summer
               surface waters, the $\delta$15N of which is lowered by ammonium
               recycling. In winter, when overall productivity and foraminifer
               production are reduced, foraminifer $\delta$15N is higher (by
               4.6 $\pm$ 0.8? for tissue and by 4.0 $\pm$ 1.5? for shell-bound
               N compared to late summer) and exhibits no clear north-south
               trend. These characteristics can also be explained by the
               feeding-driven connection of foraminifera to PON, which is
               elevated in $\delta$15N by net degradation in winter. Therefore,
               foraminifer $\delta$15N is more closely tied to PON $\delta$15N
               than to nitrate $\delta$15N in the Southern Ocean mixed layer.
               Combining our isotope data with previously reported sediment
               trap fluxes from the western Pacific SAZ/PFZ suggests that,
               under modern conditions, the late-summer ammonium recycling
               signal outweighs that of wintertime decomposition on the

               with the B/Ca proxy in photosymbiont-bearing planktonic
               foraminifera, while relatively few studies have investigated
               B/Ca in species that lack large dinoflagellate symbionts. For
               the first time, we use a sediment trap time series to evaluate
               B/Ca of subtropical and subpolar planktonic foraminifera species
               that are asymbiotic (Globigerina bulloides and Neogloboquadrina
               incompta) and a species that hosts small intrashell
               photosymbionts (Neogloboquadrina dutertrei). We find that B/Ca
               measurements across size fractions indicate overall little to no
               size-dependent uptake of boron that has previously been reported
               in some symbiont-bearing foraminifera. Neogloboquadrina incompta
               and N. dutertrei B/Ca are strongly correlated with calcite
               saturation, pH, and carbonate ion concentration, which is in
               good agreement with the limited number of published core top
               results. While G. bulloides B/Ca trends with seasonal
               fluctuations in carbonate chemistry, during discrete periods
               considerable B/Ca offsets occur when a cryptic G. bulloides

               atmospheric CO2 content, such as that which occurred during the
               last glacial-interglacial transition1. Previous studies2,3 have

               particular, the hypothesis that the glacial--interglacial shift
               in the 13C/12C ratio was due to a transfer of terrestrial carbon
               into the ocean7 can be explained alternatively by an increase in

              remain a major challenge to our understanding of the carbon cycle
              and the climate system. Leading hypotheses put forward to explain
              glacial-interglacial atmospheric CO2 variations invoke changes in
              deep-ocean carbon storage, probably modulated by processes in the
              Southern Ocean, where much of the deep ocean is ventilated. A
              central aspect of such models is that, during deglaciations, an
              isolated glacial deep-ocean carbon reservoir is reconnected with
              the atmosphere, driving the atmospheric CO2 rise observed in
              ice-core records. However, direct documentation of changes in
              surface ocean carbon content and the associated transfer of
              carbon to the atmosphere during deglaciations has been hindered
              by the lack of proxy reconstructions that unambiguously reflect
              the oceanic carbonate system. Radiocarbon activity tracks changes
              in ocean ventilation, but not in ocean carbon content, whereas
              proxies that record increased deglacial upwelling do not
              constrain the proportion of upwelled carbon that is degassed
              relative to that which is taken up by the biological pump. Here
              we apply the boron isotope pH proxy in planktic foraminifera to
              two sediment cores from the sub-Antarctic Atlantic and the
              eastern equatorial Pacific as a more direct tracer of oceanic CO2
              outgassing. We show that surface waters at both locations, which
              partly derive from deep water upwelled in the Southern Ocean,
              became a significant source of carbon to the atmosphere during
              the last deglaciation, when the concentration of atmospheric CO2
              was increasing. This oceanic CO2 outgassing supports the view
              that the ventilation of a deep-ocean carbon reservoir in the
              Southern Ocean had a key role in the deglacial CO2 rise, although
              our results allow for the possibility that processes operating in
              other regions may also have been important for the
              glacial-interglacial ocean-atmosphere exchange of carbon.",

               to 53 million years ago), was the warmest interval of the past
               65 million years, with mean annual surface air temperature over
               ten degrees Celsius warmer than during the pre-industrial
               period. Subsequent global cooling in the middle and late Eocene
               epoch, especially at high latitudes, eventually led to
               continental ice sheet development in Antarctica in the early
               Oligocene epoch (about 33.6 million years ago). However,
               existing estimates place atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels
               during the Eocene at 500-3,000 parts per million, and in the
               absence of tighter constraints carbon-climate interactions over
               this interval remain uncertain. Here we use recent analytical
               and methodological developments to generate a new high-fidelity
               record of CO2 concentrations using the boron isotope
               ($\delta$(11)B) composition of well preserved planktonic
               foraminifera from the Tanzania Drilling Project, revising
               previous estimates. Although species-level uncertainties make
               absolute values difficult to constrain, CO2 concentrations
               during the EECO were around 1,400 parts per million. The
               relative decline in CO2 concentration through the Eocene is more
               robustly constrained at about fifty per cent, with a further
               decline into the Oligocene. Provided the latitudinal dependency
               of sea surface temperature change for a given climate forcing in
               the Eocene was similar to that of the late Quaternary period,
               this CO2 decline was sufficient to drive the well documented
               high- and low-latitude cooling that occurred through the Eocene.
               Once the change in global temperature between the pre-industrial
               period and the Eocene caused by the action of all known slow
               feedbacks (apart from those associated with the carbon cycle) is
               removed, both the EECO and the late Eocene exhibit an
               equilibrium climate sensitivity relative to the pre-industrial
               period of 2.1 to 4.6 degrees Celsius per CO2 doubling (66 per
               cent confidence), which is similar to the canonical range (1.5
               to 4.5 degrees Celsius), indicating that a large fraction of the
               warmth of the early Eocene greenhouse was driven by increased
               CO2 concentrations, and that climate sensitivity was relatively
               constant throughout this period.",

               consequences of climate change for the geographical
               redistribution of terrestrial and marine species at a global
               scale. The redistribution of life on Earth has emerged as one of
               the most significant biological responses to anthropogenic
               climate warming1,2,3. Despite being one of the most
               long-standing puzzles in ecology4, we still have little
               understanding of how temperature sets geographic range
               boundaries5. Here we show that marine and terrestrial ectotherms
               differ in the degree to which they fill their potential
               latitudinal ranges, as predicted from their thermal tolerance
               limits. Marine ectotherms more fully occupy the extent of
               latitudes tolerable within their thermal tolerance limits, and
               are consequently predicted to expand at their poleward range
               boundaries and contract at their equatorward boundaries with
               climate warming. In contrast, terrestrial ectotherms are
               excluded from the warmest regions of their latitudinal range;
               thus, the equatorward, or `trailing' range boundaries, may not
               shift consistently towards the poles with climate warming. Using
               global observations of climate-induced range shifts, we test
               this prediction and show that in the ocean, shifts at both range
               boundaries have been equally responsive, whereas on land,
               equatorward range boundaries have lagged in response to climate
               warming. These results indicate that marine species' ranges
               conform more closely to their limits of thermal tolerance, and
               thus range shifts will be more predictable and coherent.
               However, on land, warmer range boundaries are not at equilibrium
               with heat tolerance. Understanding the relative contribution of
               factors other than temperature in controlling equatorward range
               limits is critical for predicting distribution changes, with

              Phenotypic plasticity underpins acclimatory responses by shifting
              the mean phenotype in a population, which may buffer the negative
              effects of global change. However, little is known about how
              phenotypic plasticity evolves across multiple generations. We
              tested this by reciprocally-transplanting the polychaete
              Ophryotrocha labronica between control and global change
              scenarios (ocean warming and acidification in isolation and
              combined) over five generations. By comparing the reaction norms
              of four life-history traits across generations, we show that
              juvenile developmental rate in the combined scenario was the only
              trait that changed its plastic response across generations when
              transplanted back to control conditions, and that adaptive

              levels of selection and strong declines in individual fitness in

              of plasticity in the combined scenario is caused by differential
              allocation of energy between the mean and the plasticity of the
              trait along the multigenerational exposure. The ability to
              maintain within-generational levels of plasticity under global

              that, mid-century predicted 1°C warming (throughout the year or
              just summer-only), increased the probability of individuals
              encountering spatial competition, as well as density and
              complexity of such interactions. 2°C, late century predicted
              warming, increased variance in the probability and density of
              competition, but overall, competition did not significantly
              differ from ambient (control) levels. In summary only 1°C warming

              high concentrations of magnesium prevent spontaneous nucleation
              and growth of crystals. Foraminifera are the most widespread
              group of calcifying organisms and generally produce calcite with
              a low Mg content, indicating that they actively remove Mg(2+)
              from vacuolized seawater before calcite precipitation. However,
              one order of foraminifera has evolved a calcification pathway, by
              which it produces calcite with a very high Mg content, suggesting
              that these species do not alter the Mg/Ca ratio of vacuolized
              seawater considerably. The cellular mechanism that makes it
              possible to precipitate calcite at high Mg concentrations,
              however, has remained unknown. Here we demonstrate that they are
              able to elevate the pH at the site of calcification by at least
              one unit above seawater pH and, thereby, overcome
              precipitation-inhibition at ambient Mg concentrations. A similar
              result was obtained for species that precipitate calcite with a
              low Mg concentration, suggesting that elevating the pH at the
              site of calcification is a widespread strategy among foraminifera
              to promote calcite precipitation. Since the common ancestor of
              these two groups dates back to the Cambrian, our results would
              imply that this physiological mechanism has evolved over half a
              billion years ago. Since foraminifera rely on elevating the
              intracellular pH for their calcification, our results show that
              ongoing ocean acidification can result in a decrease of calcite
              production by these abundant calcifyers.",

               the ratio of warming trend to short-term standard deviation.
               Short-term variability thus decreases the number of heat
               extremes, whereas a climatic warming increases it. For extremes

               carbonate chemistry with reduced growth and developmental delay.
               To date, no information exists on how ocean acidification acts
               on pH homeostasis in echinoderm larvae. Understanding acid-base
               regulatory capacities is important because intracellular
               formation and maintenance of the calcium carbonate skeleton is
               dependent on pH homeostasis. Using H(+)-selective
               microelectrodes and the pH-sensitive fluorescent dye BCECF, we
               conducted in vivo measurements of extracellular and
               intracellular pH (pH(e) and pH(i)) in echinoderm larvae. We
               exposed pluteus larvae to a range of seawater CO(2) conditions
               and demonstrated that the extracellular compartment surrounding
               the calcifying primary mesenchyme cells (PMCs) conforms to the
               surrounding seawater with respect to pH during exposure to
               elevated seawater pCO(2). Using FITC dextran conjugates, we
               demonstrate that sea urchin larvae have a leaky integument. PMCs
               and spicules are therefore directly exposed to strong changes in
               pH(e) whenever seawater pH changes. However, measurements of
               pH(i) demonstrated that PMCs are able to fully compensate an
               induced intracellular acidosis. This was highly dependent on
               Na(+) and HCO(3)(-), suggesting a bicarbonate buffer mechanism
               involving secondary active Na(+)-dependent membrane transport
               proteins. We suggest that, under ocean acidification, maintained
               pH(i) enables calcification to proceed despite decreased pH(e).
               However, this probably causes enhanced costs. Increased costs
               for calcification or cellular homeostasis can be one of the main
               factors leading to modifications in energy partitioning, which
               then impacts growth and, ultimately, results in increased
               mortality of echinoid larvae during the pelagic life stage.",

  abstract = "Predicting the conditions in which a compound adopts a metastable
              structure when it crystallizes out of solution is an unsolved and
              fundamental problem in materials synthesis, and one which, if
              understood and harnessed, could enable the rational design of
              synthesis pathways toward or away from metastable structures.
              Crystallization of metastable phases is particularly accessible
              via low-temperature solution-based routes, such as chimie douce
              and hydrothermal synthesis, but although the chemistry of the
              solution plays a crucial role in governing which polymorph forms,
              how it does so is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate an ab
              initio technique to quantify thermodynamic parameters of surfaces
              and bulks in equilibrium with an aqueous environment, enabling
              the calculation of nucleation barriers of competing polymorphs as
              a function of solution chemistry, thereby predicting the solution
              conditions governing polymorph selection. We apply this approach
              to resolve the long-standing ``calcite-aragonite problem''--the
              observation that calcium carbonate precipitates as the metastable
              aragonite polymorph in marine environments, rather than the
              stable phase calcite--which is of tremendous relevance to
              biomineralization, carbon sequestration, paleogeochemistry, and
              the vulnerability of marine life to ocean acidification. We
              identify a direct relationship between the calcite surface energy
              and solution Mg:Ca [corrected] ion concentrations, showing that
              the calcite nucleation barrier surpasses that of metastable
              aragonite in solutions with Mg:Ca ratios consistent with modern
              seawater, allowing aragonite to dominate the kinetics of
              nucleation. Our ability to quantify how solution parameters

              ecological change resulting from ocean acidification and warming
              to conceptualize broadly based change. Primary production by
              temperate noncalcifying plankton increases with elevated
              temperature and CO2, whereas tropical plankton decreases
              productivity because of acidification. Temperature increases
              consumption by and metabolic rates of herbivores, but this
              response does not translate into greater secondary production,
              which instead decreases with acidification in calcifying and
              noncalcifying species. This effect creates a mismatch with
              carnivores whose metabolic and foraging costs increase with
              temperature. Species diversity and abundances of tropical as well
              as temperate species decline with acidification, with shifts

              from ∼40,000 (∼40 ky) to ∼100 ky, and became distinctly
              asymmetrical. Testing hypotheses that implicate changing
              atmospheric CO2 levels as a driver of the MPT has proven
              difficult with available observations. Here, we use orbitally
              resolved, boron isotope CO2 data to show that the glacial to
              interglacial CO2 difference increased from ∼43 to ∼75 $\mu$atm
              across the MPT, mainly because of lower glacial CO2 levels.
              Through carbon cycle modeling, we attribute this decline
              primarily to the initiation of substantive dust-borne iron
              fertilization of the Southern Ocean during peak glacial stages.
              We also observe a twofold steepening of the relationship between
              sea level and CO2-related climate forcing that is suggestive of a
              change in the dynamics that govern ice sheet stability, such as
              that expected from the removal of subglacial regolith or

              ice sheet dynamics and that longer and deeper post-MPT ice ages
              were sustained by carbon cycle feedbacks related to dust

               differences in abundance of sessile invertebrates, herbivores,

               explained by local scale differences in hydrodynamic or physical
               conditions (wave forces, surge flow, or air temperature during
               low tide). Field experiments employing predator and herbivore
               manipulations and prey transplants suggested top-down
               (predation, grazing) processes varied positively with bottom-up
               processes (growth of filter-feeders, prey recruitment), but the
               basis for these differences was unknown. Shore-based sampling
               revealed that between-site differences were associated with
               nearshore oceanographic conditions, including phytoplankton
               concentration and productivity, particulates, and water
               temperature during upwelling. Further, samples taken at 19 sites
               along 380 km of coastline suggested that the differences
               documented between two sites reflect broader scale gradients of
               phytoplankton concentration. Among several alternative
               explanations, a coastal hydrodynamics hypothesis, reflecting

               decarbonize, and this scenario has dominated much of the public

               barnacles and mussels, taking from several hours to days to
               handle each prey item. Consequently, marked snails can be
               followed daily and accurate diet histories compiled. Such

               settling times are not considered, and as such, physiological
               responses caused by handling may become additive with those of
               experimental treatments. This study investigated the effect of
               different handling procedures on the acute physiological
               responses of green shore crab (Carcinus maenas). Handling, such
               as would occur during transport around a research facility or
               transfer during experimental procedure, was designated as light
               (10 min emersion) or severe (10 min emersion with shaking).
               Oxygen consumption (MO2) and haemolymph glucose and haemolymph
               L-lactate concentrations were elevated post-handling, the
               magnitude of the change related to the severity of handling
               stress. Glucose and L-lactate concentrations peaked within 1 h
               and returned to basal levels within 6 h, but MO2 remained
               elevated for 10 h, reflecting the additional energy required to
               oxidize L-lactate and replenish energy reserves. Differences
               between light and severe handling treatments showed that
               vibration (shaking) was a major contributor to the stress
               response, rather than the experimental emersion. This was
               confirmed in a second experiment where crabs were handled
               without emersion, and MO2 remained elevated for 14 h. In this
               experiment, the most pronounced increase in MO2 and metabolic
               parameters occurred in crabs that were physically touched and
               moved rapidly from the holding to experimental tanks. Here the
               touch, as well as vibration and visual stimuli, provoked a
               fight-flight response in the crabs. Stress responses were also
               evident in crabs gently transferred by containers. The fact that
               transferring crabs with no physical touching and minimal visual
               and vibrational stimuli still evoked a stress response, albeit
               less pronounced, supports a recommendation that crustaceans
               should be left to settle in the apparatus for at least 12 h

               microenvironment due to symbiont photosynthesis, respiration of
               the holobiont, and precipitation of the calcite shell. Under
               saturating light conditions, microprofiles measured towards the
               shell surface showed an O2 increase of up to 220\% air
               saturation, a decrease in CO2 concentration to 4.9??M, and a pH
               increase to 8.8 due to symbiont photosynthesis. The Ca2+
               concentration decreased to ?9.6?mM in two specimens, while it
               increased to 10.2?10.8?mM in three other specimens kept in
               light. In darkness, the respiration of the community decreased
               the O2 concentration to 82\% of air saturation, CO2 increased up
               to 15??M, the pH decreased to 8.0, and the Ca2+ concentration
               increased up to 10.4?mM. These data, and derived calculations of
               the distribution of HCO3 ? and CO3 2? near the shell, showed
               that the carbonate system in the vicinity of O. universa was
               significantly different from conditions in the surrounding
               seawater, both in light and darkness, due to the metabolism of

               high carbon fixation rates of the symbiotic algae via conversion
               of HCO3 ? or via CO2 release from calcification and host

               hindcast simulations with an eddy-resolving ocean biogeochemical
               model forced with observation-based variations of wind and
               fluxes of heat and freshwater. We find that domain-wide pH and
               in the top 60 m of the water column decreased significantly over
               these three decades by about −0.02 decade−1 and −0.12 decade−1,
               respectively. In the nearshore areas of northern California and
               Oregon, ocean acidification is reconstructed to have progressed
               much more rapidly, with rates up to 30\% higher than the
               domain-wide trends. Furthermore, ocean acidification penetrated
               substantially into the thermocline, causing a significant
               domain-wide shoaling of the aragonite saturation depth of on
               average −33 m decade−1 and up to −50 m decade−1 in the nearshore
               area of northern California. This resulted in a coast-wide
               increase in nearly undersaturated waters and the appearance of
               waters with , leading to a substantial reduction of habitat
               suitability. Averaged over the whole domain, the main driver of
               these trends is the oceanic uptake of anthropogenic CO2 from the
               atmosphere. However, recent changes in the climatic forcing have
               substantially modulated these trends regionally. This is
               particularly evident in the nearshore regions, where the total
               trends in pH are up to 50\% larger and trends in and in the
               aragonite saturation depth are even twice to three times larger
               than the purely atmospheric CO2-driven trends. This modulation
               in the nearshore regions is a result of the recent marked
               increase in alongshore wind stress, which brought elevated
               levels of dissolved inorganic carbon to the surface via
               upwelling. Our results demonstrate that changes in the climatic
               forcing need to be taken into consideration in future
               projections of the progression of ocean acidification in coastal
               upwelling regions.",

              and mechanical integrity of marine invertebrate skeletons",
  author   = "Byrne, Maria and Fitzer, Susan",
  abstract = "Ocean acidification (OA), from seawater uptake of anthropogenic
              CO2, has a suite of negative effects on the ability of marine
              invertebrates to produce and maintain their skeletons. Increased
              organism pCO2 causes hypercapnia, an energetically costly
              physiological stress. OA alters seawater carbonate chemistry,
              limiting the carbonate available to form the calcium carbonate
              (CaCO3) minerals used to build skeletons. The reduced saturation
              state of CaCO3 also causes corrosion of CaCO3 structures. Global
              change is also accelerating coastal acidification driven by
              land-run off (e.g. acid soil leachates, tannic acid). Building
              and maintaining marine biomaterials in the face of changing
              climate will depend on the balance between calcification and
              dissolution. Overall, in response to environmental acidification,
              many calcifiers produce less biomineral and so have smaller body
              size. Studies of skeleton development in echinoderms and molluscs
              across life stages show the stunting effect of OA. For corals,
              linear extension may be maintained, but at the expense of less
              dense biomineral. Conventional metrics used to quantify growth
              and calcification need to be augmented by characterisation of the
              changes to biomineral structure and mechanical integrity caused
              by environmental acidification. Scanning electron microscopy and
              microcomputed tomography of corals, tube worms and sea urchins
              exposed to experimental (laboratory) and natural (vents, coastal
              run off) acidification show a less dense biomineral with greater
              porosity and a larger void space. For bivalves, CaCO3 crystal
              deposition is more chaotic in response to both ocean and coastal
              acidification. Biomechanics tests reveal that these changes
              result in weaker, more fragile skeletons, compromising their
              vital protective roles. Vulnerabilities differ among taxa and
              depend on acidification level. Climate warming has the potential
              to ameliorate some of the negative effects of acidification but
              may also make matters worse. The integrative
              morphology-ecomechanics approach is key to understanding how
              marine biominerals will perform in the face of changing climate.",

  title    = "Multistressor impacts of warming and acidification of the ocean
              on marine invertebrates' life histories",
  author   = "Byrne, Maria and Przeslawski, Rachel",
  abstract = "Benthic marine invertebrates live in a multistressor world where
              stressor levels are, and will continue to be, exacerbated by
              global warming and increased atmospheric carbon dioxide. These
              changes are causing the oceans to warm, decrease in pH, become
              hypercapnic, and to become less saturated in carbonate minerals.
              These stressors have strong impacts on biological processes, but
              little is known about their combined effects on the development
              of marine invertebrates. Increasing temperature has a stimulatory
              effect on development, whereas hypercapnia can depress
              developmental processes. The pH, pCO2, and CaCO3 of seawater
              change simultaneously with temperature, challenging our ability
              to predict future outcomes for marine biota. The need to consider
              both warming and acidification is reflected in the recent
              increase in cross-factorial studies of the effects of these
              stressors on development of marine invertebrates. The outcomes
              and trends in these studies are synthesized here. Based on this
              compilation, significant additive or antagonistic effects of
              warming and acidification of the ocean are common (16 of 20
              species studied), and synergistic negative effects also are
              reported. Fertilization can be robust to near-future warming and
              acidification, depending on the male-female mating pair. Although
              larvae and juveniles of some species tolerate near-future levels
              of warming and acidification (+2°C/pH 7.8), projected far-future
              conditions (ca. $\geq$4°C/ $\leq$pH 7.6) are widely deleterious,
              with a reduction in the size and survival of larvae. It appears
              that larvae that calcify are sensitive both to warming and
              acidification, whereas those that do not calcify are more
              sensitive to warming. Different sensitivities of life-history
              stages and species have implications for persistence and
              community function in a changing ocean. Some species are more
              resilient than others and may be potential ``winners'' in the
              climate-change stakes. As the ocean will change more gradually
              over coming decades than in ``future shock'' perturbation
              investigations, it is likely that some species, particularly
              those with short generation times, may be able to tolerate
              near-future oceanic change through acclimatization and/or
              adaption.",

              saturation states is threatening the formation of calcium
              carbonate shells and exoskeletons of marine organisms. The
              production of biominerals in such organisms relies on the
              availability of carbonate and the ability of the organism to
              biomineralize in changing environments. To understand how
              biomineralizers will respond to OA the common blue mussel,
              Mytilus edulis, was cultured at projected levels of pCO2 (380,
              550, 750, 1000 µatm) and increased temperatures (ambient, ambient
              plus 2°C). Nanoindentation (a single mussel shell) and
              microhardness testing were used to assess the material properties
              of the shells. Young's modulus (E), hardness (H) and toughness
              (KIC) were measured in mussel shells grown in multiple stressor
              conditions. OA caused mussels to produce shell calcite that is
              stiffer (higher modulus of elasticity) and harder than shells
              grown in control conditions. The outer shell (calcite) is more
              brittle in OA conditions while the inner shell (aragonite) is
              softer and less stiff in shells grown under OA conditions.
              Combining increasing ocean pCO2 and temperatures as projected for
              future global ocean appears to reduce the impact of increasing
              pCO2 on the material properties of the mussel shell. OA may cause
              changes in shell material properties that could prove problematic
              under predation scenarios for the mussels; however, this may be

              generated by approaches like RAD sequencing. However, few
              empirical studies have directly compared the ability of these
              methods to resolve population structure. This could have
              implications for understanding phenotypic plasticity, as many

              to detect genetic differences, especially over micro-geographic
              scales. We therefore compared the ability of microsatellites and
              RAD sequencing to resolve fine-scale population structure in a
              commercially important benthic invertebrate by genotyping great
              scallops (Pecten maximus) from nine populations around Northern
              Ireland at 13 microsatellites and 10 539 SNPs. The shells were
              then subjected to morphometric and colour analysis in order to
              compare patterns of phenotypic and genetic variation. We found
              that RAD sequencing was superior at resolving population
              structure, yielding higher Fst values and support for two
              distinct genetic clusters, whereas only one cluster could be
              detected in a Bayesian analysis of the microsatellite dataset.
              Furthermore, appreciable phenotypic variation was observed in
              size-independent shell shape and coloration, including among
              localities that could not be distinguished from one another
              genetically, providing support for the notion that these traits
              are phenotypically plastic. Taken together, our results suggest

              hardparts have a range of taxon-specific compositions and
              microstructures, and it is evident that these may influence
              susceptibilities to dissolution. Here, we show how dissolution
              (thickness loss), under both ambient and predicted end-century pH
              (approx. 7.6), varies between seven different bivalve molluscs
              and one crustacean biocomposite and investigate how this relates
              to details of their microstructure and composition. Over 100
              days, the dissolution of all microstructures was greater under
              the lower pH in the end-century conditions. Dissolution of
              lobster cuticle was greater than that of any bivalve

               to be linked to some genetically based mechanism. In order to
               forage, the dogwhelks had to leave a refugium, traverse empty
               'habitat' and enter a patch of mussels serving as prey. Wave
               action markedly depressed foraging activity, increased foraging
               latency and lowered the patch-residence-time index. Dogwhelks
               derived from populations naturally occurring on shores exposed
               to wave action reduced their foraging activity less strongly
               than those derived from sheltered-shore populations, but
               geographical origin (Plymouth or Anglesey) had no significant
               influence on foraging behaviour. A simple interpretation was
               offered, linking the differential behavioural response to
               habitat-specific shell morphology, known to be heritable.
               According to this interpretation, all dogwhelks react similarly
               to the drag forces generated by wave action, but the relatively
               shorter-spired shells of exposed-shore dogwhelks cause weaker
               resultant forces than the taller-spired shells of
               sheltered-shore individuals. Consequently, exposed-shore
               dogwhelks tolerate higher levels of wave action than
               sheltered-shore morphs before suppressing their foraging
               behaviour. As exposed-shore dogwhelks have greater tenacity
               associated with relatively larger pedal area, the increased
               tolerance of wave action extends opportunities for foraging
               without incurring extra risk of dislodgement. The
               sheltered-shore morphology, which imparts greater resistance to
               desiccation, coincidentally increases drag and so makes
               dogwhelks more likely to seek refuge during occasional periods
               of heavy wave action. Exposed- and sheltered-shore morphologies
               therefore represent genotype/environment interaction that is
               apparently adaptive, in part, through its effect on foraging
               behaviour.",

              shells from two Native American midden sites (∼1000-2420 years

              age category and thinner per unit length. Thus, the largest
              individuals of this species are calcifying less now than in the

              the past 10-40 years, however, do not show significant shell

              the detrimental effects of extreme conditions, but the infrequent
              occurrence of extreme environments and/or their restriction to
              low-quality habitats within a species range means that they exert
              little direct selection on reaction norms. Plasticity could,
              therefore, be maladaptive under extreme environments, unless
              genetic correlations are strong between extreme and non-extreme
              environmental states, and the optimum phenotype changes smoothly
              with the environment. Empirical evidence suggests that
              populations and species from more variable environments show
              higher levels of plasticity that might preadapt them to extremes,
              but genetic variance for plastic responses can also be low, and
              genetic variation may not be expressed for some classes of traits

              plastic responses to extremes has not yet been linked to

               with ecological data, reflecting the complexities and
               interactions of the natural world, can be a challenge. Recent
               innovations for statistical analysis of multifaceted
               interrelated data make obtaining more accurate and meaningful
               results possible, but key decisions of the analyses to use, and
               which components to present in a scientific paper or report, may
               be overwhelming. We offer a 10-step protocol to streamline
               analysis of data that will enhance understanding of the data,
               the statistical models and the results, and optimize
               communication with the reader with respect to both the procedure
               and the outcomes. The protocol takes the investigator from study
               design and organization of data (formulating relevant questions,
               visualizing data collection, data exploration, identifying
               dependency), through conducting analysis (presenting, fitting
               and validating the model) and presenting output (numerically and
               visually), to extending the model via simulation. Each step
               includes procedures to clarify aspects of the data that affect
               statistical analysis, as well as guidelines for written

               complex biocomposites with proteins, which although typically
               less than 5\% of total shell mass, play significant roles in
               determining shell microstructure. Despite much research effort,
               large knowledge gaps remain in how molluscs construct and
               maintain their shells, and how they produce such a great
               diversity of forms. Here we synthesize results on how shell
               shape, microstructure, composition and organic content vary
               among, and within, species in response to numerous biotic and
               abiotic factors. At the local level, temperature, food supply
               and predation cues significantly affect shell morphology, whilst
               salinity has a much stronger influence across latitudes.
               Moreover, we emphasize how advances in genomic technologies
               [e.g. restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-Seq) and
               epigenetics] allow detailed examinations of whether
               morphological changes result from phenotypic plasticity or
               genetic adaptation, or a combination of these. RAD-Seq has
               already identified single nucleotide polymorphisms associated
               with temperature and aquaculture practices, whilst epigenetic
               processes have been shown significantly to modify shell
               construction to local conditions in, for example, Antarctica and
               New Zealand. We also synthesize results on the costs of shell
               construction and explore how these affect energetic trade-offs
               in animal metabolism. The cellular costs are still debated, with
               CaCO3 precipitation estimates ranging from 1-2 J/mg to 17-55
               J/mg depending on experimental and environmental conditions.
               However, organic components are more expensive (~29 J/mg) and
               recent data indicate transmembrane calcium ion transporters can
               involve considerable costs. This review emphasizes the role that
               molecular analyses have played in demonstrating multiple
               evolutionary origins of biomineralization genes. Although these
               are characterized by lineage-specific proteins and unique
               combinations of co-opted genes, a small set of protein domains
               have been identified as a conserved biomineralization tool box.
               We further highlight the use of sequence data sets in providing
               candidate genes for in situ localization and protein function
               studies. The former has elucidated gene expression modularity in
               mantle tissue, improving understanding of the diversity of shell
               morphology synthesis. RNA interference (RNAi) and clustered
               regularly interspersed short palindromic repeats -
               CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR-Cas9) experiments have
               provided proof of concept for use in the functional
               investigation of mollusc gene sequences, showing for example
               that Pif (aragonite-binding) protein plays a significant role in
               structured nacre crystal growth and that the Lsdia1 gene sets
               shell chirality in Lymnaea stagnalis. Much research has focused
               on the impacts of ocean acidification on molluscs. Initial
               studies were predominantly pessimistic for future molluscan
               biodiversity. However, more sophisticated experiments
               incorporating selective breeding and multiple generations are
               identifying subtle effects and that variability within mollusc
               genomes has potential for adaption to future conditions.
               Furthermore, we highlight recent historical studies based on
               museum collections that demonstrate a greater resilience of
               molluscs to climate change compared with experimental data. The
               future of mollusc research lies not solely with ecological
               investigations into biodiversity, and this review synthesizes
               knowledge across disciplines to understand biomineralization. It
               spans research ranging from evolution and development, through
               predictions of biodiversity prospects and future-proofing of

              there were no differences between p CO 2 treatments, indicating
              that trans-generational effects enabled the restoration and
              maintenance of reproductive output. Whilst the initial fitness
              recovery was likely driven by trans-generational plasticity

               quantified across depth (1 m to 7 m) along a cultivation rope at
               a mussel farm on the West coast of Scotland. A single nuclear
               marker (Me15/16) and a novel panel of 33 MT-diagnostic single
               nucleotide polymorphisms were used to evaluate stock structure
               and the extent of MT introgression across depth. Variation in

              Both genetic evolution in reaction norm elevation and plasticity
              are favored by slow temporal fluctuations, with plasticity, in
              the absence of microenvironmental variability, being the dominant

              fluctuations, tracking of the optimal phenotype through genetic

              the optimal phenotype are large and stabilizing selection is
              strong, selection then acts to increase the phenotypic variance
              (bet-hedging adaptive). Otherwise, canalizing selection occurs.
              If the phenotypic variance increases with plasticity through the

               Baltic Sea) is a brackish (12-20 g kg(-1) ) and CO2 enriched
               habitat, but the blue mussel Mytilus edulis dominates the
               benthic community. In a coupled field and laboratory study we
               examined the annual pCO2 variability in this habitat and the
               combined effects of elevated pCO2 and food availability on
               juvenile M. edulis growth and calcification. In the laboratory
               experiment, mussel growth and calcification were found to
               chiefly depend on food supply, with only minor impacts of pCO2
               up to 3350 $\mu$atm. Kiel Fjord was characterized by strong
               seasonal pCO2 variability. During summer, maximal pCO2 values of
               2500 $\mu$atm were observed at the surface and >3000 $\mu$atm at
               the bottom. However, the field growth experiment revealed seven
               times higher growth and calcification rates of M. edulis at a
               high pCO2 inner fjord field station (mean pCO2 ca. 1000
               $\mu$atm) in comparison to a low pCO2 outer fjord station (ca.
               600 $\mu$atm). In addition, mussels were able to out-compete the
               barnacle Amphibalanus improvisus at the high pCO2 site. High
               mussel productivity at the inner fjord site was enabled by
               higher particulate organic carbon concentrations. Kiel Fjord is
               highly impacted by eutrophication, which causes bottom water
               hypoxia and consequently high seawater pCO2 . At the same time,
               elevated nutrient concentrations increase the energy
               availability for filter feeding organisms such as mussels. Thus,
               M. edulis can dominate over a seemingly more acidification
               resistant species such as A. improvisus. We conclude that
               benthic stages of M. edulis tolerate high ambient pCO2 when food
               supply is abundant and that important habitat characteristics
               such as species interactions and energy availability need to be

              comprehensive meta-analysis to date by synthesizing the results
              of 228 studies examining biological responses to ocean
              acidification. The results reveal decreased survival,
              calcification, growth, development and abundance in response to
              acidification when the broad range of marine organisms is pooled
              together. However, the magnitude of these responses varies among
              taxonomic groups, suggesting there is some predictable
              trait-based variation in sensitivity, despite the investigation
              of approximately 100 new species in recent research. The results
              also reveal an enhanced sensitivity of mollusk larvae, but
              suggest that an enhanced sensitivity of early life history stages
              is not universal across all taxonomic groups. In addition, the
              variability in species' responses is enhanced when they are

              focuses on short-term, individual-level impacts in isolation. We
              address this shortcoming first through an interdisciplinary
              ensemble of novel experimental techniques to investigate the
              impacts of 14-month exposure to ocean acidification and warming
              (OAW) on the physiology, activity, predatory behaviour and
              susceptibility to predation of an important marine gastropod
              (Nucella lapillus). We simultaneously estimated the potential
              impacts of these global drivers on N. lapillus population
              dynamics and dispersal parameters. We then used these data to
              parameterize a dynamic bioclimatic envelope model, to investigate
              the consequences of OAW on the distribution of the species in the
              wider NE Atlantic region by 2100. The model accounts also for
              changes in the distribution of resources, suitable habitat and
              environment simulated by finely resolved biogeochemical models,
              under three IPCC global emissions scenarios. The experiments
              showed that temperature had the greatest impact on
              individual-level responses, while acidification had a similarly
              important role in the mediation of predatory behaviour and
              susceptibility to predators. Changes in Nucella predatory
              behaviour appeared to serve as a strategy to mitigate
              individual-level impacts of acidification, but the development of
              this response may be limited in the presence of predators. The
              model projected significant large-scale changes in the
              distribution of Nucella by the year 2100 that were exacerbated by
              rising greenhouse gas emissions. These changes were spatially
              heterogeneous, as the degree of impact of OAW on the combination
              of responses considered by the model varied depending on
              local-environmental conditions and resource availability. Such
              changes in macro-scale distributions cannot be predicted by
              investigating individual-level impacts in isolation, or by
              considering climate stressors separately. Scaling up the results
              of experimental climate change research requires approaches that

               organisms are potentially vulnerable to the stressors associated
               with global change, but identifying general patterns across
               studies, species and response variables is challenging. This
               review represents the first meta-analysis of multistressor
               studies to target early marine life stages (embryo to larvae),
               particularly between temperature, salinity and pH as these are
               the best studied. Knowledge gaps in research on multiple abiotic
               stressors and early life stages are also identified. The
               meta-analysis yielded several key results: (1) Synergistic
               interactions (65\% of individual tests) are more common than
               additive (17\%) or antagonistic (17\%) interactions. (2) Larvae
               are generally more vulnerable than embryos to thermal and pH
               stress. (3) Survival is more likely than sublethal responses to
               be affected by thermal, salinity and pH stress. (4) Interaction
               types vary among stressors, ontogenetic stages and biological
               responses, but they are more consistent among phyla. (5) Ocean
               acidification is a greater stressor for calcifying than
               noncalcifying larvae. Despite being more ecologically realistic
               than single-factor studies, multifactorial studies may still
               oversimplify complex systems, and so meta-analyses of the data
               from them must be cautiously interpreted with regard to
               extrapolation to field conditions. Nonetheless, our results
               identify taxa with early life stages that may be particularly
               vulnerable (e.g. molluscs, echinoderms) or robust (e.g.
               arthropods, cnidarians) to abiotic stress. We provide a list of

              examine large-scale spatial variations in biomineralization under
              heterogeneous environmental gradients of temperature, salinity
              and food availability across a 30° latitudinal range (3,334 km),
              to test whether plasticity in calcareous shell production and
              composition, from juveniles to large adults, mediates
              geographical patterns of resilience to climate change in critical
              foundation species, the mussels Mytilus edulis and M. trossulus.
              We find shell calcification decreased towards high latitude, with
              mussels producing thinner shells with a higher organic content in
              polar than temperate regions. Salinity was the best predictor of
              within-region differences in mussel shell deposition, mineral and
              organic composition. In polar, subpolar, and Baltic low-salinity
              environments, mussels produced thin shells with a thicker
              external organic layer (periostracum), and an increased
              proportion of calcite (prismatic layer, as opposed to aragonite)
              and organic matrix, providing potentially higher resistance
              against dissolution in more corrosive waters. Conversely, in
              temperate, higher salinity regimes, thicker, more calcified
              shells with a higher aragonite (nacreous layer) proportion were
              deposited, which suggests enhanced protection under increased
              predation pressure. Interacting effects of salinity and food
              availability on mussel shell composition predict the deposition

              under forecasted future environmental conditions, suggesting a
              capacity for increased protection of high-latitude populations

              in the ocean, leading to a growing recognition of the dynamism of
              the marine environment as well as new questions about how this
              dynamism may influence species' vulnerability to global
              environmental change. In some instances, the diurnal or seasonal
              variability in major environmental change drivers, such as
              temperature, pH and seawater carbonate chemistry, and dissolved
              oxygen, can exceed the changes expected with continued
              anthropogenic global change. While ocean global change biologists
              have begun to experimentally test how variability in
              environmental conditions mediates species' responses to changes
              in the mean, the extensive literature on species' adaptations to
              temporal variability in their environment and the implications of
              this variability for their evolutionary responses has not been
              well integrated into the field. Here, we review the physiological
              mechanisms underlying species' responses to changes in
              temperature, pCO2 /pH (and other carbonate parameters), and
              dissolved oxygen, and discuss what is known about behavioral,
              plastic, and evolutionary strategies for dealing with variable
              environments. In addition, we discuss how exposure to variability
              may influence species' responses to changes in the mean
              conditions and highlight key research needs for ocean global

              Current understanding of organismal responses to change stems
              from studies over relatively short timescales. However, most
              projections lack long-term observations incorporating the

              mechanism for resistance to altered environmental conditions and
              predation impacts in a calcifying foundation species. We

              km of Belgian coastline, along with records of key environmental
              descriptors and predators. Contrary to global-scale predictions,
              shell production increased over the last century, highlighting a
              protective capacity of mussels for qualitative and quantitative
              trade-offs in biomineralization as compensatory responses to
              altered environments. We also demonstrated the role of changes in

               against increasing extreme heat due to climate change. LOCATION:
               Global. TIME PERIOD: 1960 to 2015. MAJOR TAXA STUDIED:
               Amphibians, arthropods, brachiopods, cnidarians, echinoderms,
               fishes, molluscs, reptiles. METHODS: We draw together new and
               existing data quantifying the warm acclimation response in 319
               species as the acclimation response ratio (ARR): the increase in
               upper thermal limit per degree increase in experimental
               temperature. We develop worst‐case scenario climate projections
               to calculate the number of years and generations gained by ARR
               until loss of thermal safety. We further compute a vulnerability
               score that integrates across variables estimating exposure to
               climate change and species‐specific tolerance through traits,
               including physiological plasticity, generation time and
               latitudinal range extent. RESULTS: ARR is highly variable, but
               with marked differences across taxa, habitats and latitude.
               Polar terrestrial arthropods show high ARRs [95\% upper
               confidence limit (UCL95\%) = 0.68], as do some polar aquatic
               invertebrates that were acclimated for extended durations (ARR >
               0.4). While this physiological plasticity buys 100s of years
               until thermal safety is lost, combination with long generation
               times leads to decreased potential for evolutionary adaptation.
               Additionally, 27\% of marine polar invertebrates have no
               capacity for acclimation and reptiles and amphibians have
               minimal ARR (UCL95\% = 0.16). Low physiological plasticity, long
               generations times and restricted latitudinal ranges combine to
               distinguish reptiles, amphibians and polar invertebrates as
               being highly vulnerable amongst ectotherms. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: In
               some taxa the combined effects of acclimation capacity and
               generation time can provide 100s of years and generations before
               thermal safety is lost. The accuracy of assessments of
               vulnerability to climate change will be improved by considering
               multiple aspects of species' biology that, in combination may
               increase persistence under extreme heat events, and increase the
               probability for evolutionary rescue.",

  abstract  = "Summary 1 The role of phenotypic plasticity in evolution has
               historically been a contentious issue because of debate over
               whether plasticity shields genotypes from selection or generates
               novel opportunities for selection to act. Because plasticity
               encompasses diverse adaptive and non-adaptive responses to
               environmental variation, no single conceptual framework
               adequately predicts the diverse roles of plasticity in
               evolutionary change. 2 Different types of phenotypic plasticity
               can uniquely contribute to adaptive evolution when populations
               are faced with new or altered environments. Adaptive plasticity
               should promote establishment and persistence in a new
               environment, but depending on how close the plastic response is
               to the new favoured phenotypic optimum dictates whether
               directional selection will cause adaptive divergence between
               populations. Further, non-adaptive plasticity in response to
               stressful environments can result in a mean phenotypic response
               being further away from the favoured optimum or alternatively
               increase the variance around the mean due to the expression of
               cryptic genetic variation. The expression of cryptic genetic
               variation can facilitate adaptive evolution if by chance it
               results in a fitter phenotype. 3 We conclude that adaptive
               plasticity that places populations close enough to a new
               phenotypic optimum for directional selection to act is the only
               plasticity that predictably enhances fitness and is most likely
               to facilitate adaptive evolution on ecological time-scales in
               new environments. However, this type of plasticity is likely to
               be the product of past selection on variation that may have been
               initially non-adaptive. 4 We end with suggestions on how future
               empirical studies can be designed to better test the importance
               of different kinds of plasticity to adaptive evolution.",

               model of the river system, has been coupled to MIRO-CO2, a
               complex biogeochemical model describing diatom and Phaeocystis
               blooms and carbon and nutrient cycles in the marine domain, to
               assess the dual role of changing nutrient loads and increasing
               atmospheric CO2 as drivers of air?sea CO2 exchanges in the
               Southern North Sea with a focus on the Belgian coastal zone
               (BCZ). The whole area, submitted to the influence of two main
               rivers (Seine and Scheldt), is characterized by variable diatom
               and Phaeocystis colonies blooms which impact on the trophic
               status and air?sea CO2 fluxes of the coastal ecosystem. For this
               application, the MIRO-CO2 model is implemented in a 0D multibox
               frame covering the eutrophied Eastern English Channel and
               Southern North Sea and receiving loads from the rivers Seine and
               Scheldt. Model simulations are performed for the period between
               1951 and 1998 using real forcing fields for sea surface
               temperature, wind speed and atmospheric CO2 and RIVERSTRAHLER
               simulations for river carbon and nutrient loads. Model results
               suggest that the BCZ shifted from a source of CO2 before 1970
               (low eutrophication) towards a sink during the 1970?1990 period
               when anthropogenic DIN and P loads increased, stimulating C
               fixation by autotrophs. In agreement, a shift from net annual
               heterotrophy towards autotrophy in BCZ is simulated from 1980.
               The period after 1990 is characterized by a progressive decrease
               of P loads concomitant with a decrease of primary production and
               of the CO2 sink in the BCZ. At the end of the simulation period,
               the BCZ ecosystem is again net heterotroph and acts as a source
               of CO2 to the atmosphere. R-MIRO-CO2 scenarios testing the
               relative impact of temperature, wind speed, atmospheric CO2 and
               river loads variability on the simulated air?sea CO2 fluxes
               suggest that the trend in air?sea CO2 fluxes simulated between
               1951 and 1998 in the BCZ was mainly controlled by the magnitude
               and the ratio of inorganic nutrient river loads. Quantitative
               nutrient changes control the level of primary production while
               qualitative changes modulate the relative contribution of
               diatoms and Phaeocystis to this flux and hence the sequestration
               of atmospheric CO2.",

              skeleton mass and thickness. Here, taxonomically controlled
              latitudinal variations in shell morphology and composition were
              investigated in bivalve and gastropod molluscs, brachiopods, and
              echinoids. Total inorganic content, a proxy for skeletal CaCO3 ,
              decreased with latitude, decreasing seawater temperature, and
              decreasing seawater carbonate saturation state (for CaCO3 as
              calcite ($\Omega$cal )) in all taxa. Shell mass decreased with
              latitude in molluscs and shell inorganic content decreased with
              latitude in buccinid gastropods. Shell thickness decreased with
              latitude in buccinid gastropods (excepting the Australian
              temperate buccinid) and echinoids, but not brachiopods and
              laternulid clams. In the latter, the polar species had the
              thickest shell. There was no latitudinal trend in shell thickness
              within brachiopods. The variation in trends in shell thickness by
              taxon suggests that in some circumstances ecological factors may
              override latitudinal trends. Latitudinal gradients may produce
              effects similar to those of future CO2 -driven ocean
              acidification on CaCO3 saturation state. Responses to latitudinal
              trends in temperature and saturation state may therefore be
              useful in informing predictions of organism responses to ocean
              acidification over long-term adaptive timescales.",

              populating North Atlantic rocky shores. As with many other
              gastropod species, N. lapillus was affected by tributyltin (TBT)
              pollution during the 1970s and 1980s, when local populations
              became extinct. After a partial ban on TBT in the United Kingdom
              in 1987, vacant sites have been recolonized. N. lapillus lacks a
              planktonic larval stage and is therefore expected to have limited
              dispersal ability. Relatively fast recolonization of some sites,
              however, contradicts this assumption. We compared levels of
              genetic diversity and genetic structuring between recolonized
              sites and sites that showed continuous population at three
              localities across the British Isles. No significant genetic
              effects of extinction/recolonization events were observed in SW
              Scotland and NE England. In SW England we observed a decrease in
              genetic diversity and an increase in genetic structure in
              recolonized populations. This last result could be an artefact,
              however, due to the superposition of other local factors
              influencing the genetic structuring of dogwhelk populations. We
              conclude that recolonization of vacant sites was accomplished by
              a relatively high number of individuals originating from several
              source populations (the 'migrant-pool' model of recolonization),

              dispersal supports this hypothesis. Our results also stress the

               Twenty-eight species (including many bryozoans) occurred only in
               the former, while 15 species occurred solely in the latter. Ten
               of the 25 species common to both areas were more numerous in

               availability of free substratum and food in this area. The
               species richness of fouling communities in Port Kembla Harbour
               was found to decrease as pollutant concentrations increased. In

               different types of species. In addition, the classification

               principal coordinate analysis of the data was able to further

               whereby one group of species (ascidians) was gradually replaced

               dominated by inhibitory interactions. The succession in this

  abstract  = "Summary.? Recent work by Reiss and Ogden provides a theoretical
               basis for sometimes preferring restricted maximum likelihood
               (REML) to generalized cross-validation (GCV) for smoothing
               parameter selection in semiparametric regression. However,
               existing REML or marginal likelihood (ML) based methods for
               semiparametric generalized linear models (GLMs) use iterative
               REML or ML estimation of the smoothing parameters of working
               linear approximations to the GLM. Such indirect schemes need not
               converge and fail to do so in a non-negligible proportion of
               practical analyses. By contrast, very reliable prediction error
               criteria smoothing parameter selection methods are available,
               based on direct optimization of GCV, or related criteria, for
               the GLM itself. Since such methods directly optimize properly
               defined functions of the smoothing parameters, they have much
               more reliable convergence properties. The paper develops the
               first such method for REML or ML estimation of smoothing
               parameters. A Laplace approximation is used to obtain an
               approximate REML or ML for any GLM, which is suitable for
               efficient direct optimization. This REML or ML criterion
               requires that Newton?Raphson iteration, rather than Fisher
               scoring, be used for GLM fitting, and a computationally stable
               approach to this is proposed. The REML or ML criterion itself is
               optimized by a Newton method, with the derivatives required
               obtained by a mixture of implicit differentiation and direct
               methods. The method will cope with numerical rank deficiency in
               the fitted model and in fact provides a slight improvement in
               numerical robustness on the earlier method of Wood for
               prediction error criteria based smoothness selection. Simulation
               results suggest that the new REML and ML methods offer some
               improvement in mean-square error performance relative to GCV or
               Akaike's information criterion in most cases, without the small
               number of severe undersmoothing failures to which Akaike's
               information criterion and GCV are prone. This is achieved at the
               same computational cost as GCV or Akaike's information
               criterion. The new approach also eliminates the convergence
               failures of previous REML- or ML-based approaches for penalized
               GLMs and usually has lower computational cost than these
               alternatives. Example applications are presented in adaptive
               smoothing, scalar on function regression and generalized

              their evolutionary bets' against the variability of the
              environment. The idea of bet-hedging arises from the fact that
              appropriate measure of long-term fitness is sensitive to
              variance, leading to the potential for strategies with a reduced
              mean fitness to invade and increase in frequency. Our aim is to
              review the conceptual foundation of bet-hedging as a mechanism
              that influences short- and long-term evolutionary processes. We
              do so by presenting a general model showing how evolutionary
              changes are affected by variance in fitness and how genotypic
              variance in fitness can be separated into variance in fitness at
              the level of the individuals and correlations in fitness among
              them. By breaking down genotypic fitness variance in this way the
              traditional divisions between conservative and diversified
              strategies are more easily intuited, and it is also shown that
              this division can be considered a false dichotomy, and is better
              viewed as two extreme points on a continuum. The model also sheds
              light on the ideas of within- and between-generation bet-hedging,
              which can also be generalized to be seen as two ends of a
              different continuum. We use a simple example to illustrate the

  title     = "Visible variation in the dog‐whelk, {\textit{Nucella lapillus}}",

  abstract  = "Shell shape and colour variation is common in littoral molluscs.
               As far as shape is concerned, exposure to wave action acts as a
               strong agent of natural selection, but only speculation seems to
               have been directed towards elucidating the determinants of
               colour variation. In the dog-whelk (Nucella lapillus (L.)) diet
               may play some part in producing the pigment for colour. However
               white and banded forms are often found in otherwise coloured
               colonies. This study describes the classification for colour and
               banding of 83,524 whelks from 444 areas around the British Isles
               and west Atlantic coast. Colour and banding were significantly
               correlated r=0.45$\pm$0.05). Because of the possible involvement
               of diet in shell colour, attention has been confined to banded
               forms. No obvious pattern in distribution could be discerned.
               Possible factors affecting the occurrence and incidence of
               banding are: climate; geology; exposure to wave action;
               predation; intra- or interspecific competition; cryptic
               genetical factors; or intraspecific recognition. The only one
               which was definitely associated with banding frequency was
               exposure (r= 0.33$\pm$0.05), but there were so many exceptions
               to the correlation (e.g. highly exposed populations which were
               entirely unhanded), that this is unlikely to be causal. The most
               probable explanation seems to be the local spread of mutant
               forms (probably linked to fitness traits), which have not
               attained equilibrium frequencies?even though N. lapillus has
               apparently occurred in large colonies round much of the British
               coast since the end of the Pleistocene.",

               exoskeletons from calcite rather than aragonite have a greater

               constituent mineralogy in determining the rate of shell loss in
               cold waters. Moreover, the loss of shell material was minimal,
               corresponding to an annual loss in shell thickness of 3?40 ?m
               depending on microstructure. These findings must cast doubt on
               the commonly held supposition that calcitic layers added to the

              skeletons is thought to be a key factor that fuelled the
              expansion of multicellular animal life during the early Cambrian.
              The genes and molecular mechanisms that control the process of
              biomineralization in disparate phyla are gradually being
              revealed, and it is broadly recognized that an insoluble matrix
              of proteins, carbohydrates and other organic molecules are
              required for the initiation, regulation and inhibition of crystal
              growth. Here, we show that Astrosclera willeyana, a living
              representative of the now largely extinct stromatoporid sponges
              (a polyphyletic grade of poriferan bauplan), has apparently
              bypassed the requirement to evolve many of these
              mineral-regulating matrix proteins by using the degraded remains
              of bacteria to seed CaCO(3) crystal growth. Because stromatoporid

              eras (fulfilling the role that stony corals play in modern coral
              reefs), and fossil evidence suggests that the same process of
              bacterial skeleton formation occurred in these stromatoporid

              variation and phenotypic plasticity in the adhesive abilities of
              the intertidal snail Nucella lapillus between high- and
              low-wave-energy environments. Whelks from an exposed coast
              produced a larger pedal surface area and were more resistant to
              dislodgement than were similar-sized individuals from a protected
              shore. Tenacity (g/cm2 ) was similar between individuals from
              exposed and protected shores, indicating that variation in
              resisting dislodgement was solely a function of pedal surface
              area. Whelks from exposed and protected shores did not differ in
              pedal surface area as they emerged from egg capsules or when
              reared in the laboratory under uniform conditions, suggesting
              that variation between populations does not represent genetic
              differentiation. Individuals from high-and low-wave-energy
              environments reared intertidally produced a larger pedal surface
              area than did those reared in the laboratory. The extent to which
              pedal surface area increased corresponded to the intensity of
              wave action. These findings suggest that pedal surface area is a
              highly plastic character modulated or induced by the water
              turbulence accompanying breaking waves. A reciprocal-transplant
              experiment confirmed this notion but revealed an asymmetry in the
              plasticity. Snails from the protected site transplanted to an
              exposed shore formed a much larger pedal surface area than did
              controls reared on the protected shore. In contrast, whelks from
              a wave-swept shore transplanted to a protected shore differed
              little from their controls reared on the exposed shore. The
              asymmetric response parallels a possible asymmetry in the risks
              of acclimating to a temporally unpredictable environmental cue,

               physical environment necessarily changes, but molluscs and
               brachiopods whose accretionary skeletons expand at one end of a
               hollow cone conform to logarithmic-spiral growth and retain a
               constant shape. Dissolution and remodelling of previously formed
               parts of the skeleton can alleviate the constraints of strict
               logarithmic-spiral growth. How, when, where and in which clades
               mineral skeletal resorption has evolved are important questions
               because they relate to the conditions and history of skeletal
               formation and to the way in which ocean acidification in the
               past influenced that history. A synthesis of data on mineral
               dissolution in shells shows that resorption from the inner
               surface of bivalve shells occurs under temporarily anaerobic
               conditions within the closed shell, but functional remodelling
               is unknown in bivalves. Resorption and functional remodelling
               occur in brachiopods, gastropods and terrestrial hermit crabs,
               and to a lesser extent in scaphopods and cephalopods. Internal
               whorl resorption leading to a more compact visceral mass has
               evolved at least ten times in gastropods. Contrary to
               expectations stemming from patterns in the availability of
               calcium, gastropod remodelling is a phenomenon of warm,
               calcium-rich environments and not of cold acidified conditions.
               There is therefore no evidence that internal whorl resorption
               increases calcium-use efficiency. Resorption is one of several
               mechanisms that have enabled animal skeletons to become more

              production costs explain these trends-remains untested. Using
              field-collected specimens spanning a 79°N to 68°S latitudinal
              gradient (16,300 km), we conducted a taxonomically controlled
              evaluation of energetic costs of shell production as a proportion
              of the total energy budget in mollusks. Shell production cost was
              fairly low across latitudes at <10\% of the energy budget and
              predominately <5\% in gastropods and <4\% in bivalves. Throughout
              life, shell cost tended to be lower in tropical species and
              increased slightly toward the poles. However, shell cost also
              varied with life stage, with the greatest costs found in young
              tropical gastropods. Low shell production costs on the energy
              budget suggest that shell cost may play only a small role in
              influencing proportional skeleton size gradients across latitudes
              relative to other ecological factors, such as predation in
              present-day oceans. However, any increase in the cost of calcium
              carbonate (CaCO3) deposition, including from ocean acidification,
              may lead to a projected ~50 to 70\% increase in the proportion of
              the total energy budget required for shell production for a
              doubling of the CaCO3 deposition cost. Changes in energy budget

               (ESB) program blue mussels (Mytilus edulis Complex) are sampled
               regularly since the 1980s. The samples are collected in
               two-monthly intervals at two North Sea sites and in 6-month

               sub-samples under cryogenic conditions. In order to investigate

               while maintaining comparability with the long-term composite
               sample data, the seasonal variability of metals/metalloids was
               analyzed based on the half-yearly and bimonthly samples of 2013,
               2015 and 2017. In mussels from the North Sea site
               Eckwarderhoerne seasonality of metals/metalloids was comparable

               Sea site Koenigshafen seasonality of cobalt, nickel, cadmium,
               copper, lead, and arsenic was comparable in 2013 and 2015 but
               not in 2017, while selenium showed the same seasonality in all 3

               carefully selecting the sampling time point when using mussels

              decrease in many species, but compelling evidence of impaired
              functional performance of calcium carbonate structures is sparse,
              particularly in key species. Here we demonstrate that ocean
              acidification markedly degrades the mechanical integrity of
              larval shells in the mussel Mytilus californianus, a critical
              community member on rocky shores throughout the northeastern
              Pacific. Larvae cultured in seawater containing CO(2)
              concentrations expected by the year 2100 (540 or 970 ppm)
              precipitated weaker, thinner and smaller shells than individuals
              raised under present-day seawater conditions (380 ppm), and also
              exhibited lower tissue mass. Under a scenario where mussel larvae
              exposed to different CO(2) levels develop at similar rates, these
              trends suggest a suite of potential consequences, including an
              exacerbated vulnerability of new settlers to crushing and
              drilling attacks by predators; poorer larval condition, causing
              increased energetic stress during metamorphosis; and greater
              risks from desiccation at low tide due to shifts in shell area to
              body mass ratios. Under an alternative scenario where responses
              derive exclusively from slowed development, with impacted
              individuals reaching identical milestones in shell strength and
              size by settlement, a lengthened larval phase could increase
              exposure to high planktonic mortality rates. In either case,
              because early life stages operate as population bottlenecks,
              driving general patterns of distribution and abundance, the

              ocean, may have profound impacts on marine biota. Calcareous
              organisms are expected to be particularly sensitive due to the
              decreasing availability of carbonate ions driven by decreasing pH
              levels. Recently, some studies focused on the early life stages
              of mollusks that are supposedly more sensitive to environmental
              disturbances than adult stages. Although these studies have shown
              decreased growth rates and increased proportions of abnormal
              development under low pH conditions, they did not allow
              attribution to pH induced changes in physiology or changes due to
              a decrease in aragonite saturation state. This study aims to
              assess the impact of several carbonate-system perturbations on
              the growth of Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) larvae during
              the first 3 days of development (until shelled D-veliger larvae).
              Seawater with five different chemistries was obtained by
              separately manipulating pH, total alkalinity and aragonite
              saturation state (calcium addition). Results showed that the
              developmental success and growth rates were not directly affected
              by changes in pH or aragonite saturation state but were highly
              correlated with the availability of carbonate ions. In contrast
              to previous studies, both developmental success into viable
              D-shaped larvae and growth rates were not significantly altered
              as long as carbonate ion concentrations were above aragonite
              saturation levels, but they strongly decreased below saturation
              levels. These results suggest that the mechanisms used by these
              organisms to regulate calcification rates are not efficient
              enough to compensate for the low availability of carbonate ions
              under corrosive conditions.",

              emissions will alter marine ecosystem processes. Calcifying
              organisms might be particularly vulnerable to these alterations
              in the speciation of the marine carbonate system. While previous
              research efforts have mainly focused on external dissolution of
              shells in seawater under saturated with respect to calcium
              carbonate, the internal shell interface might be more vulnerable
              to acidification. In the case of the blue mussel Mytilus edulis,
              high body fluid pCO(2) causes low pH and low carbonate
              concentrations in the extrapallial fluid, which is in direct
              contact with the inner shell surface. In order to test whether
              elevated seawater pCO(2) impacts calcification and inner shell
              surface integrity we exposed Baltic M. edulis to four different
              seawater pCO(2) (39, 142, 240, 405 Pa) and two food algae
              (310-350 cells mL(-1) vs. 1600-2000 cells mL(-1)) concentrations
              for a period of seven weeks during winter (5°C). We found that
              low food algae concentrations and high pCO(2) values each
              significantly decreased shell length growth. Internal shell
              surface corrosion of nacreous ( = aragonite) layers was
              documented via stereomicroscopy and SEM at the two highest pCO(2)
              treatments in the high food group, while it was found in all
              treatments in the low food group. Both factors, food and pCO(2),
              significantly influenced the magnitude of inner shell surface
              dissolution. Our findings illustrate for the first time that
              integrity of inner shell surfaces is tightly coupled to the
              animals' energy budget under conditions of CO(2) stress. It is
              likely that under food limited conditions, energy is allocated to
              more vital processes (e.g. somatic mass maintenance) instead of
              shell conservation. It is evident from our results that mussels
              exert significant biological control over the structural
              integrity of their inner shell surfaces.",

              studied to which extent pH elevation within their
              microenvironments in daylight can counteract ambient seawater pH
              reductions, i.e. OA conditions. We measured the O(2) and pH
              microenvironment of four photosymbiotic and two symbiont-free
              benthic tropical foraminiferal species at three different OA

              OA treatments (except in individuals that exhibited symbiont
              loss, i.e. bleaching, at elevated pCO(2)). The pH at the cell
              surface decreased during incubations at elevated pCO(2), also
              during light incubations. Photosynthesis increased the surface pH
              but this increase was insufficient to compensate for ambient

               of those recaptured 12 months later. Snails transplanted to the

               relatively thicker shell lips than controls, the level of
               response being similar between lineages. F(2) progeny of the

               passive consequence of starvation and that heritable and plastic
               control of defensive shell morphology act synergistically. Shell
               thickening of juveniles was similar between lineages, contrary

              species, assessing 1208 long-term datasets from 89 studies on 347

              Zealand), South America and the Antarctic/subantarctic, and
              focused primarily on plants and birds. This meta-analysis shows
              an advance in the timing of spring events (with a strong
              Australian data bias), although substantial differences in trends
              were apparent among taxonomic groups and regions. When only
              statistically significant trends were considered, 82\% of
              terrestrial datasets and 42\% of marine datasets demonstrated an
              advance in phenology. Temperature was most frequently identified
              as the primary driver of phenological changes; however, in many
              studies it was the only climate variable considered. When
              precipitation was examined, it often played a key role but, in
              contrast with temperature, the direction of phenological shifts

              past and current data collection and analyses at large regional
              scales (with very few studies in the tropics or from Africa) and
              dramatic taxonomic biases. If accurate predictions regarding the
              general effects of climate change on the biology of organisms are
              to be made, data collection policies focussing on targeting

              chemistry parameters coupled with seasonal changes in the mean
              conditions define periods during the year when a reef habitat is
              exposed to anomalous thermal and/or pH exposure. Anomalous
              conditions are defined as values that exceed an empirically
              estimated threshold for each variable. We present a 200-day time
              series from June through December 2010 of carbonate chemistry and
              environmental parameters measured on the Heron Island reef flat.
              These data reveal that aragonite saturation state, pH, and pCO2
              were primarily modulated by biologically-driven changes in
              dissolved organic carbon (DIC) and total alkalinity (TA), rather
              than salinity and temperature. The largest diel temperature
              ranges occurred in austral spring, in October (1.5 - 6.6°C) and
              lowest diel ranges (0.9 - 3.2°C) were observed in July, at the
              peak of winter. We observed large diel total pH variability, with
              a maximum range of 7.7 - 8.5 total pH units, with minimum diel
              average pH values occurring during spring and maximum during
              fall. As with many other reefs, the nighttime pH minima on the
              reef flat were far lower than pH values predicted for the open
              ocean by 2100. DIC and TA both increased from June (end of Fall)
              to December (end of Spring). Using this high-resolution dataset,
              we developed exposure metrics of pH and temperature individually

  abstract = "Ocean acidification (OA) is altering the chemistry of the world's
              oceans at rates unparalleled in the past roughly 1 million years.
              Understanding the impacts of this rapid change in baseline
              carbonate chemistry on marine organisms needs a precise,
              mechanistic understanding of physiological responses to carbonate
              chemistry. Recent experimental work has shown shell development
              and growth in some bivalve larvae, have direct sensitivities to
              calcium carbonate saturation state that is not modulated through
              organismal acid-base chemistry. To understand different modes of
              action of OA on bivalve larvae, we experimentally tested how pH,
              PCO2, and saturation state independently affect shell growth and
              development, respiration rate, and initiation of feeding in
              Mytilus californianus embryos and larvae. We found, as documented
              in other bivalve larvae, that shell development and growth were
              affected by aragonite saturation state, and not by pH or PCO2.
              Respiration rate was elevated under very low pH (~7.4) with no
              change between pH of ~ 8.3 to ~7.8. Initiation of feeding
              appeared to be most sensitive to PCO2, and possibly minor
              response to pH under elevated PCO2. Although different components
              of physiology responded to different carbonate system variables,
              the inability to normally develop a shell due to lower saturation
              state precludes pH or PCO2 effects later in the life history.
              However, saturation state effects during early shell development
              will carry-over to later stages, where pH or PCO2 effects can
              compound OA effects on bivalve larvae. Our findings suggest OA
              may be a multi-stressor unto itself. Shell development and growth
              of the native mussel, M. californianus, was indistinguishable
              from the Mediterranean mussel, Mytilus galloprovincialis,
              collected from the southern U.S. Pacific coast, an area not
              subjected to seasonal upwelling. The concordance in responses
              suggests a fundamental OA bottleneck during development of the
              first shell material affected only by saturation state.",

              water temperature, in laboratory controlled conditions, on the
              last stages of pearl mineralization in order to assess their
              impact on pearl quality. To this end, grafted pearl oysters were
              fed at different levels of food and subjected to different water
              temperatures one month prior to harvest to evaluate the effect of
              these factors on 1) pearl and shell deposition rate, 2)
              expression of genes involved in biomineralization in pearl sacs,
              3) nacre ultrastructure (tablet thickness and number of tablets
              deposited per day) and 4) pearl quality traits. Our results
              revealed that high water temperature stimulates both shell and
              pearl deposition rates. However, low water temperature led to
              thinner nacre tablets, a lower number of tablets deposited per
              day and impacted pearl quality with better luster and fewer
              defects. Conversely, the two tested food level had no significant
              effects on shell and pearl growth, pearl nacre ultrastructure or
              pearl quality. However, one gene, Aspein, was significantly
              downregulated in high food levels. These results will be helpful
              for the pearl industry. A wise strategy to increase pearl quality
              would be to rear pearl oysters at a high water temperature to
              increase pearl growth and consequently pearl size; and to harvest
              pearls after a period of low water temperature to enhance luster
              and to reduce the number of defects.",

               and consisting of a short pointed spire, dominated by the last
               whorl. The shell is usually up to 3 cm in height by 2 cm broad
               but may reach up to 6 cm in height (Crothers, 1985). The shell
               colour is variable, usually white, but may be grey, brown, or
               yellow, occasionally with contrasting (usually brown) spiral
               banding. A short, open siphonal canal leads from base of the
               aperture. The outer lip of the aperture is thin in young
               specimens, becoming thickened and toothed internally with age.
               The shell shape, shell thickness and relative size of the
               aperture vary with wave exposure. In some populations, mainly

               the majority of its latitudinal range from Washington to
               southern California, USA. Using long-term (five years),
               high-frequency temperature records recorded at multiple sites,
               we tested the hypothesis that local ?modifying factors? such as
               the timing of low tide in summer can lead to large-scale
               geographic mosaics of body temperature. Our results show that
               patterns of body temperature during aerial exposure at low tide
               vary in physiologically meaningful and often counterintuitive
               ways over large sections of this species' geographic range. We
               evaluated the spatial correlations among sites to explore how
               body temperatures change along the latitudinal gradient, and
               these analyses show that ?hot spots? and ?cold spots? exist
               where temperatures are hotter or colder than expected based on
               latitude. We identified four major hot spots and four cold spots
               along the entire geographic gradient with at least one hot spot
               and one cold spot in each of the three regions examined
               (Washington?Oregon, Central California, and Southern
               California). Temporal autocorrelation analysis of year-to-year
               consistency and temporal predictability in the mussel body
               temperatures revealed that southern animals experience higher
               levels of predictability in thermal signals than northern
               animals. We also explored the role of wave splash at a subset of
               sites and found that, while average daily temperature extremes
               varied between sites with different levels of wave splash,
               yearly extreme temperatures were often similar, as were patterns
               of predictability. Our results suggest that regional patterns of
               tidal regime and local pattern of wave splash can overwhelm
               those of large-scale climate in driving patterns of body
               temperature, leading to complex thermal mosaics of temperature
               rather than simple latitudinal gradients. A narrow focus on
               population changes only at range margins may overlook
               climatically forced local extinctions and other population
               changes at sites well within a species range. Our results
               emphasize the importance of quantitatively examining
               biogeographic patterns in environmental variables at scales
               relevant to organisms, and in forecasting the impacts of changes

               significant differences in endogenous levels of hsp70 as
               functions of season and collection height. Strong induction of
               new hsp70 synthesis occurred at body temperatures within the

  author    = "Morgan, Peter R",
  abstract  = "[(1) An isolated population of Nucella lapillus lives on Old
               Den, a pebble bank in the Humber Estuary surrounded by mud. This
               is an unusual habitat for Nucella for it is not normally
               associated either with shingle or mud. (2) Before 1962 Nucella
               relied on Balanus as a food source, but in the period 1962/64
               Balanus was destroyed, and Nucella turned to Cerastoderma edule,
               a thinly-scattered prey washed on to the bank from the mud banks
               which surrounded it. (3) In 1965 Balanus resettled on the bank,
               and Nucella in the area resumed feeding on it. The settlement of
               Balanus induced a considerable emigration of Nucella from areas
               where it fed on Cerastoderma. (4) Nucella feeding on Balanus
               were more contagiously distributed than those feeding on
               Cerastoderma. (5) Nucella seeking Cerastoderma travelled between
               two and three times the distance travelled by Nucella seeking
               Balanus. This was associated with the dispersive behaviour of
               Nucella seeking thinly-scattered prey. (6) Nucella feeding on
               Cerastoderma were more rapacious than those feeding on Balanus.
               It was concluded that the rapacity of Nucella depended on the
               availability of food in the natural environment. (7) When given
               a choice, most Nucella preferred Mytilus as food. (8) Nucella
               accustomed to feeding on cockles in natural conditions readily
               consumed them in the laboratory, unlike barnacle-fed Nucella.
               This trait was partially lost when Nucella were provided with
               Balanus or Mytilus but was regained if cockles were provided in
               the absence of other food organisms. The mechanism involved with
               the acquisition of a taste for a new prey organism may be
               described as associative learning. (9) The efficiency of prey
               penetration in Nucella partly depends on the amount of
               experience gained by the predator.]",

  abstract  = "[(1) Shore crabs attack dogwhelks by attempting to crush the
               shell. Because of differences in shell morphology, sheltered
               shore dogwhelks tend to be opened by removal of the apex and
               exposed shore dogwhelks by breaking the columella. (2) The
               proportion of successful attacks is unity for small dogwhelks
               but decreases rapidly as the shells grow and become more robust.
               The attack success rate curve begins to fall at a smaller shell
               height in sheltered than in exposed shore dogwhelks. Large adult
               sheltered shore dogwhelks are immune to attack. (3) For large
               male shore crabs preying on sheltered shore dogwhelks, prey
               value (energy yielded per unit handling time) forms a steep
               normal curve when plotted against shell height, peaking at about
               14 mm. Because of the rapidly decreasing attack success rate,
               the prey value of individuals between the optimum and about 27
               mm height is very unpredictable. (4) When presented with an
               abundance of prey in each size category in the laboratory, shore
               crabs did not specialize on the optimal size as predicted by
               optimal foraging theory. All encountered prey were attacked but
               rejected if unbroken after 0.25 to 2.75 minutes. Very small
               dogwhelks were sometimes dropped accidentally. As a result of
               these mechanical processes, optimally sized dogwhelks were the
               most frequently eaten. (5) The foraging tactics seem to be the
               most appropriate for prey types which have unpredictable prey
               values and are sparsely distributed so that encounter rates are
               always low. Most intertidal gastropods are of this type. The
               foraging tactics applied to dogwhelks contrast with those
               applied to mussels where prey value is predictable and encounter
               rates are high. (6) Exposed shore dogwhelks living in the
               virtual absence of shore crabs are much more vulnerable to
               attack than sheltered shore dogwhelks suffering high crab
               predation. Sheltered shore dogwhelks are better protected
               because of a narrower mouth which excludes the chelae of
               attacking crabs and a thicker, more robust shell. These
               attributes were even more pronounced in a sublittoral-fringe
               population of dogwhelks exposed to the more powerful edible
               crab. (7) The narrower mouth of sheltered shore dogwhelks is
               produced by a more elongated spiral growth form. This does not
               reduce the relative size of the visceral mass but it does reduce
               the relative area of the foot. (8) The thicker, more robust
               shell of sheltered shore dogwhelks results in a heavier load per
               g flesh and may represent a metabolic cost of the anti-predator
               adaptation. Such a cost is possibly unimportant because
               sublittoral-fringe dogwhelks frequently carry an extra load of
               encrusting barnacles, without any reduction in relative size of
               the visceral mass or total flesh weight. (9) Selective deaths
               caused by crab predation must occur below a shell height of
               about 27 mm. The most vulnerable stages, below about 14 mm
               height, tend to be inaccessible to crabs because of their
               propensity to remain under stones or within crevices. The habit
               of foraging on the outer surfaces of stones is acquired only by
               large dogwhelks and since many of these will be over 27 mm in
               height, only a few will likely fall prey to shore crabs.]",

               The dogwhelk shells from the sheltered site were stronger, mass
               for mass, than those from the very exposed site. The shells from
               the intermediate site were intermediate. (3) The stronger
               dogwhelk shells, coming from a site where predation pressure is
               almost certainly intense, protected less body mass per unit
               shell mass than did shells from more exposed sites. (4) These
               results confirm quantitatively the suggestion of Hughes \& Elner
               (1979) that sheltered--shore dogwhelks have stronger shells, at
               the same time incurring greater metabolic cost. (5) The winkle
               shells showed little difference between sites. (6) The lack of
               difference between the winkles from different sites is probably

  author    = "Avery, R and Etter, R J",
  abstract  = "Gastropod shells are important antipredator structures that vary
               morphologically in response to predation risk, often increasing
               in thickness when the risk of predation is greater. Because the
               shell is composed of different microstructures that vary in
               energetic cost and strength, shell thickness may be increased in
               different ways. We tested whether the common intertidal snail
               Nucella lapillus differs in microstructure between shores with
               different predation risk, and whether any differences in
               microstructure affect shell strength. Predation risk varies with
               degree of wave exposure, so we compared shell microstructure and
               strength between snails from different exposure regimes. N.
               lapillus shells are made of a strong but energetically expensive
               crossed lamellar microstructure and a weaker but less
               energetically expensive homogeneous microstructure. Independent
               of exposure regime, the homogeneous microstructure was used to
               thicken the shell as snails increase in size. The thickness of
               the stronger crossed-lamellar microstructure changes little with
               snail size or predator risk. Whelks from wave-protected shores,
               where predation risk is high, have much thicker shells than
               conspecifics from exposed shores, where predation risk is low.
               The greater thickness is largely due to a disproportionate
               increase in the thickness of the homogeneous layer, and this
               increase translates into a much stronger shell. The advantage of
               using the weaker microstructure may lie in the fact that it is
               energetically cheaper and can be deposited more quickly,
               allowing snails to grow more rapidly to a size refuge.
               Reinforcing the shell with weaker and energetically cheaper
               materials that allow rapid growth to a size refuge may be a more
               important strategy for reducing the risk of predation than
               simply maximizing strength.",

               used to explore various controls over elemental partitioning in

               biomineralization-pathway-level controls, the influence of

               biocalcification responses to changes in seawater carbonate

               phylogenetic patterns of elemental partitioning across

               multivariate: $\lambda$ = 0.895--0.99). Comparing partial R2
               values returned from non-phylogenetic and phylogenetic
               regression analyses echo the importance of and show that
               phylogeny explains the elemental ratio data 1.4--59 times better
               than mineralogy in five out of nine of the elements analyzed.

  abstract = "In coastal temperate regions such as the Baltic Sea, calcifying
              bivalves dominate benthic communities playing a vital ecological
              role in maintaining biodiversity and nutrient recycling. At low
              salinities, bivalves exhibit reduced growth and calcification
              rates which is thought to result from physiological constraints
              associated with osmotic stress. Calcification demands a
              considerable amount of energy in calcifying molluscs and
              estuarine habitats provide sub-optimal conditions for
              calcification due to low concentrations of calcification
              substrates and large variations in carbonate chemistry.
              Therefore, we hypothesize that slow growth rates in estuarine
              bivalves result from increased costs of calcification, rather
              than costs associated with osmotic stress. To investigate this,
              we estimated the cost of calcification for the first time in
              benthic bivalve life stages and the relative energy allocation to
              calcification in three Mytilus populations along the Baltic
              salinity gradient. Our results indicate that calcification rates
              are significantly reduced only in 6 psu populations compared to
              11 and 16 psu populations, coinciding with ca. 2--3-fold higher
              calcification costs at low salinity and temperature. This
              suggests that reduced growth of Baltic Mytilus at low salinities
              results from increased calcification costs rather than osmotic
              stress related costs. We also reveal that shell growth (both
              calcification and shell organic production) demands 31--60\% of
              available assimilated energy from food, which is significantly
              higher than previous estimates. Energetically expensive
              calcification represents a major constraint on growth of mytilids
              in the estuarine and coastal seas where warming, acidification
              and desalination are predicted over the next century.",

              aggregates is attributed to the action of proteins. There was,
              however, only direct evidence that the mineral phase, and
              indirect evidence that nucleation and the crystal shape, are
              determined by the types of soluble proteins. Some authors imply
              that crystal competition may also play a role. In addition, the
              fabrication of intergranular organic matrices typical of some
              microstructures (nacre, columnar prismatic) cannot have a
              protein-based explanation. Over the last decade I and
              collaborators have been applying a holistic view, based on
              analyzing and interpreting the features of both the organic
              (mantle, extrapallial space, periostracum, organic matrices) and
              inorganic (crystallite morphology, arrangement, and
              crystallography) components of the biomineralization system. By
              interpreting them on biophysical principles, we have accumulated
              evidence that, in addition to the activity of proteins, other
              mechanisms contribute in an essential way to the organization of
              molluscan microstructures. In particular, we have identified
              processes such as: (1) crystal nucleation on preformed membranes,
              (2) nucleation and growth of crystals between and within
              self-organized membranes, (3) active subcellular processes of
              contact recognition and deposition. In summary, besides the
              activity of organic macromolecules, physical (crystal
              competition, self-organization) and/or biological (direct
              cellular activity) processes may operate in the fabrication of
              microstructures. The balance between the physical and biological
              determinants varies among microstructures, with some being based
              exclusively on either physical or biological processes, and
              others having a mixed nature. Other calcifying invertebrates
              (e.g., corals, cirripeds, serpulids) secrete microstructures that
              are very similar to inorganic crystal aggregates, and only some
              brachiopods and, to a lesser extent, bryozoans may have secretory
              abilities comparable to those of molluscs. Here I provide a new
              perspective, which may allow microstructures to be understood in
              terms of evolutionary constraints, to compare the secretional
              abilities among taxa, and even to evaluate the probability of
              mimicking microstructures for the production of functional
              synthetic materials.",

              habitat-forming foundation species is well-understood, it is
              unclear how they impact the oxygen concentration and pH of the
              surrounding seawater, and further, how such a dynamic abiotic
              environment will affect eco-evolutionary dynamics in a context of
              global change. Here, we profiled the nearshore kelp forest
              environment in Southern California to understand changes in
              dissolved oxygen (DO) and pH with high spatiotemporal resolution.
              We then examined transgenerational effects using sea urchins
              (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) as our study organism. Using
              enclosures on the benthos, we conditioned adult sea urchins in
              situ at two locations -- one inside the kelp forest and one
              outside the kelp forest. After a 11-week conditioning period
              timed to coincide with gametogenesis in the adults, the urchins
              were collected, spawned, and cultures of their progeny were
              raised in the laboratory in order to assess their performance to
              simulated ocean acidification. In terms of the physical
              observations, we observed significant changes in DO and pH not
              only when comparing sites inside and outside of the kelp forest,
              but also between surface and benthic sensors at the same site. DO
              and pH at the benthos differed in mean, the amplitude of the diel
              signal, and in the profile of background noise of the signal.
              Ultimately, these results indicated that both DO and pH were more
              predictably variable inside of the kelp forest environment. On
              the biological side, we found that adult sea urchins inside the
              kelp forest produced more protein-rich eggs that developed into
              more pH-resilient embryos. Overall, this study in a temperate
              kelp forest ecosystem is one of the first studies to not only
              observe biological response to highly characterized environmental
              variability in situ, but also to observe such changes in a
              transgenerational context.",

              There is open discussion regarding whether low D3 is caused by
              the infection or if deficiency negatively affects immune defense.
              The aim of this study was to collect further evidence on this
              topic. METHODS: Systematic literature search was performed to
              identify retrospective cohort as well as clinical studies on
              COVID-19 mortality rates versus D3 blood levels. Mortality rates
              from clinical studies were corrected for age, sex, and diabetes.
              Data were analyzed using correlation and linear regression.
              RESULTS: One population study and seven clinical studies were
              identified, which reported D3 blood levels preinfection or on the
              day of hospital admission. The two independent datasets showed a
              negative Pearson correlation of D3 levels and mortality risk
              (r(17) = -0.4154, p = 0.0770/r(13) = -0.4886, p = 0.0646). For
              the combined data, median (IQR) D3 levels were 23.2 ng/mL
              (17.4-26.8), and a significant Pearson correlation was observed
              (r(32) = -0.3989, p = 0.0194). Regression suggested a theoretical
              point of zero mortality at approximately 50 ng/mL D3.
              CONCLUSIONS: The datasets provide strong evidence that low D3 is
              a predictor rather than just a side effect of the infection.

  title     = "A New Critical Estimate of Named {Species-Level} Diversity of
               the Recent Mollusca*",
  author    = "Rosenberg, Gary",
  abstract  = "Modern estimates of species-level diversity in the recent
               Mollusca range from 34,000 to 120,000 described species, with
               total diversity including undescribed species often cited as
               200,000. Most estimates are unverifiable, not being based on
               reproducible methods. Ultimately the best way to gauge diversity
               is explicit enumeration: actual listing of known species.
               Comprehensive lists of species are valued as a basis for
               systematic revisions and for comparing diversity across taxa,
               but it is less appreciated that they also provide a means for
               statistical sampling of biodiversity databases. I assessed the
               completeness of molluscan species listings in the World Register
               of Marine Species (WoRMS) by comparing it to a standardized
               inventory of the species represented in the Malacology
               collection of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia
               (ANSP). Random samples of names were scored for presence or
               absence in WoRMS, with standard errors calculated from the
               binomial distribution. The WoRMS database has about 1,200
               duplicate or extraneous listings for mollusk species and is
               missing about 1,300 (3\%). Overall marine molluscan diversity is
               estimated at 43,600 $\pm$ 900 species, where 900 is a 95\%
               confidence interval. The validity of this confidence interval
               depends on the WoRMS database and the ANSP collection not having
               correlated weaknesses. Lack of relatively complete species
               databases prevents similar assessments for terrestrial and
               freshwater mollusks, but, using less rigorous methods, I
               estimate that there are 70,000 to 76,000 described species of
               recent Mollusca.The low end of this estimate, 70,000 species, is
               similar to the number of recent chordate species, 69,000, so it
               is possible that the Mollusca are not the second most diverse
               phylum of animals in terms of recognized recent species. Naming
               rates for chordate are currently higher than for mollusk, 750
               versus 600 species per year, although the Mollusca are regarded
               as having higher undescribed diversity. The Mollusca have long
               been considered the most species-rich marine phylum, but the
               estimate of 43,600 is substantially below the 56,000 species of
               Arthropoda listed in WoRMS. Globally, the ratio of marine
               gastropod to marine bivalve species in WoRMS is 4:1, which is
               higher than in any regional fauna, suggesting that gastropods
               have smaller geographic ranges on average than bivalves. The
               main remaining gaps in WoRMS are among opisthobranchs (8\%
               missing) and Indo-Pacific marine mollusks (6\%). The most
               diverse molluscan genus in WoRMS is Turbonilla, with more than
               1,000 species listed as accepted.",

               such as mussels, affecting their physiology and vertical
               distribution. Comparative studies of the mussel Mytilus
               trossulus from two depth zones (10 m and 40 m) over a seasonal
               cycle revealed ecophysiologic differences between deep- and
               shallow-water animals. For the same shell length, the
               shallow-water mussels were heavier (dry weight = 0.004L2.297)
               and showed a higher weight index (dry weight/volume), averaging
               3.8 $\pm$ 1.9 mg cm?3, than the deep-water mussels (dry weight =
               0.0002L1.726 and 2.5 $\pm$ 1.1 mg cm?3), primarily because of a
               nearly twofold greater carbohydrate store. In the shallow zone,
               females contained more carbohydrates (on average 5.8\% dry
               weight) than males (3.8\% dry weight) because females conserve
               energy for reproduction. Differences in physiologic variables,
               and subsequently physiologic performance of the mussels, were
               related to different nutritional conditions in the ambient
               water. The deep habitat had lower Chl a, averaging 1.1 mg L?1,
               total particulate matter (TPM) 4.3 mg L?1 and particulate
               organic matter (POM) 1.1\% of TPM as compared with the shallow
               habitat, with average Chl a 2.5 mg L?1, TPM 4.9 mg L?1, and POM
               1.5\%. The eutrophication of the Gulf of Gda?sk has led to an
               increase in the food availability in the water column, which
               allowed efficient colonization of the deep zone by the mussels;
               however, the dominance of males over females (~3 : 1) suggests
               that the food sustains only spawning-related metabolic demands
               and is not sufficient for energy conservation in this zone.
               Starch gel electrophoresis of eight enzyme loci showed no
               statistical differences in the allele and genotype frequencies
               between the shallow- and deep-water mussels; thus, the

  abstract  = "The rise in atmospheric CO2 has caused significant decrease in
               sea surface pH and carbonate ion (CO3-2) concentration. This
               decrease has a negative effect on calcification in hermatypic
               corals and other calcifying organisms. We report the results of
               three laboratory experiments designed specifically to separate
               the effects of the different carbonate chemistry parameters (pH,
               CO3-2, CO2 [aq], total alkalinity [AT], and total inorganic
               carbon [CT]) on the calcification, photosynthesis, and
               respiration of the hermatypic coral Acropora eurystoma. The
               carbonate system was varied to change pH (7.9-8.5), without
               changing CT; CT was changed keeping the pH constant, and CT was
               changed keeping the pCO2 constant. In all of these experiments,
               calcification (both light and dark) was positively correlated
               with CO3-2 concentration, suggesting that the corals are not
               sensitive to pH or CT but to the CO3-2 concentration. A decrease
               of ~30\% in the CO3-2 concentration (which is equivalent to a
               decrease of about 0.2 pH units in seawater) caused a
               calcification decrease of about 50\%. These results suggest that
               calcification in today's ocean (pCO2 = 370 ppm) is lower by
               ~20\% compared with preindustrial time (pCO2 = 280 ppm). An
               additional decrease of ~35\% is expected if atmospheric CO2
               concentration doubles (pCO2 = 560 ppm). In all of these
               experiments, photosynthesis and respiration did not show any
               significant response to changes in the carbonate chemistry of
               seawater. Based on this observation, we propose a mechanism by
               which the photosynthesis of symbionts is enhanced by coral
               calcification at high pH when CO2(aq) is low. Overall it seems
               that photosynthesis and calcification support each other mainly
               through internal pH regulation, which provides CO3-2 ions for
               calcification and CO2(aq) for photosynthesis.",

               Globigerinoides ruber, Orbulina universa, and Globigerinella
               siphonifera and their symbiotic algae were calculated from
               measured dissolved oxygen gradients using microelectrodes, using
               different temperatures in dark and light (250 µmol photon m?2
               s?1) conditions. At one temperature (24ºC) the respiration rate
               increased as a power function of the foraminiferan organic
               carbon mass with a 0.57 $\pm$ 0.18 exponent. The effect of
               temperature on respiration was quantified in two ways: by
               normalizing the rates to the organic carbon mass and by
               normalizing the observed rates to a constant temperature (24ºC).
               This latter normalization was also used for photosynthesis. The
               respiration rates increase as a function of temperature for all
               species and can be described either with a Q10 = 3.18
               ($\pm$0.27) or with an Arrhenius temperature of TA = 10,293ºK
               ($\pm$768ºK). Similar calculations for net photosynthesis
               yielded a Q10 = 2.68 ($\pm$0.36) and a TA = 8766ºK
               ($\pm$1203ºK), and calculations for gross photosynthesis yielded
               a Q10 = 2.76 (60.29) and a TA = 9026ºK ($\pm$926ºK). For the
               species studied, the photosynthesis : respiration ratio varied
               from moderate for G. siphonifera (0.58) to very high (13) for O.
               universa. The high ratios indicate that photosynthesis is much
               higher than the carbon requirements for both foraminifera and
               symbiont growth. This excess carbon might be the source of
               organic exudates.",

               chemistry calculations, based on well-known thermodynamic
               equilibria, are now available in a dozen public packages. Ten of
               those were compared using common input data and the set of
               equilibrium constants recommended for best practices. Current
               versions of all 10 packages agree within 0.2 $\mu$atm for pCO2,
               0.0002 units for pH, and 0.1 $\mu$mol kg−1 for CO32− in terms of
               surface zonal-mean values. That represents more than a 10-fold
               improvement relative to outdated versions of the same packages.
               Differences between packages grow with depth for some computed
               variables but remain small. Discrepancies derive largely from
               differences in equilibrium constants. Analysis of the

               Best-practice formulations for K1 and K2 are implemented

               marine bivalves",
  author    = "Thomsen, J and Haynert, K and Wegner, K M and Melzner, F",
  abstract  = "Abstract. Bivalve calcification, particularly of the early
               larval stages, is highly sensitive to the change in ocean
               carbonate chemistry resulting from atmospheric CO2 uptake.
               Earlier studies suggested that declining seawater [CO32−] and
               thereby lowered carbonate saturation affect shell production.
               However, disturbances of physiological processes such as
               acid-base regulation by adverse seawater pCO2 and pH can affect
               calcification in a secondary fashion. In order to determine the
               exact carbonate system component by which growth and
               calcification are affected it is necessary to utilize more
               complex carbonate chemistry manipulations. As single factors,
               pCO2 had no effects and [HCO3-] and pH had only limited effects
               on shell growth, while lowered [CO32−] strongly impacted
               calcification. Dissolved inorganic carbon (CT) limiting
               conditions led to strong reductions in calcification, despite
               high [CO32−], indicating that [HCO3-] rather than [CO32−] is the
               inorganic carbon source utilized for calcification by mytilid
               mussels. However, as the ratio [HCO3-] / [H+] is linearly
               correlated with [CO32−] it is not possible to differentiate
               between these under natural seawater conditions. An equivalent
               of about 80 $\mu$mol kg−1 [CO32−] is required to saturate
               inorganic carbon supply for calcification in bivalves. Below
               this threshold biomineralization rates rapidly decline. A
               comparison of literature data available for larvae and juvenile
               mussels and oysters originating from habitats differing
               substantially with respect to prevailing carbonate chemistry
               conditions revealed similar response curves. This suggests that
               the mechanisms which determine sensitivity of calcification in
               this group are highly conserved. The higher sensitivity of
               larval calcification seems to primarily result from the much
               higher relative calcification rates in early life stages. In
               order to reveal and understand the mechanisms that limit or
               facilitate adaptation to future ocean acidification, it is
               necessary to better understand the physiological processes and
               their underlying genetics that govern inorganic carbon
               assimilation for calcification.",

               ecosystem to ocean acidification, and large-scale assessments of
               pH and the saturation state for aragonite ($\Omega$arag) have
               led to the notion that the Arctic Ocean is already close to a
               corrosive state. In high-latitude coastal waters the regulation
               of pH and $\Omega$arag is, however, far more complex than
               offshore because increased biological activity and input of
               glacial meltwater affect pH. Effects of ocean acidification on
               calcifiers and non-calcifying phototrophs occupying coastal
               habitats cannot be derived from extrapolation of current and
               forecasted offshore conditions, but they require an
               understanding of the regimes of pH and $\Omega$arag in their
               coastal habitats. To increase knowledge of the natural
               variability in pH in the Arctic coastal zone and specifically to
               test the influence of benthic vegetated habitats, we quantified
               pH variability in a Greenland fjord in a nested-scale approach.
               A sensor array logging pH, O2, PAR, temperature and salinity was
               applied on spatial scales ranging from kilometre scale across
               the horizontal extension of the fjord; to 100 m scale vertically
               in the fjord, 10--100 m scale between subtidal habitats with and
               without kelp forests and between vegetated tidal pools and
               adjacent vegetated shores; and to centimetre to metre scale
               within kelp forests and millimetre scale across diffusive
               boundary layers of macrophyte tissue. In addition, we assessed
               the temporal variability in pH on diurnal and seasonal scales.
               Based on pH measurements combined with point samples of total
               alkalinity, dissolved inorganic carbon and relationships to
               salinity, we also estimated variability in $\Omega$arag. Results
               show variability in pH and $\Omega$arag of up to 0.2--0.3 units
               at several scales, i.e. along the horizontal and vertical
               extension of the fjord, between seasons and on a diel basis in
               benthic habitats and within 1 m3 of kelp forest. Vegetated
               intertidal pools exhibited extreme diel pH variability of > 1.5
               units and macrophyte diffusive boundary layers a pH range of up
               to 0.8 units. Overall, pelagic and benthic metabolism was an
               important driver of pH and $\Omega$arag producing mosaics of
               variability from low levels in the dark to peak levels at high
               irradiance generally appearing favourable for calcification. We
               suggest that productive coastal environments may form niches of
               high pH in a future acidified Arctic Ocean.",

  author    = "Bach, L T",
  abstract  = "Abstract. Marine organisms precipitate 0.5--2.0 Gt of carbon as
               calcium carbonate (CaCO3) every year with a profound impact on
               global biogeochemical element cycles. Biotic calcification
               relies on calcium ions (Ca2+) and usually on bicarbonate ions
               (HCO3−) as CaCO3 substrates and can be inhibited by high proton
               (H+) concentrations. The seawater concentration of carbonate
               ions (CO32−) and the CO32−-dependent CaCO3 saturation state
               ($\Omega$CaCO3) seem to be irrelevant in this production
               process. Nevertheless, calcification rates and the success of
               calcifying organisms in the oceans often correlate surprisingly
               well with these two carbonate system parameters. This study
               addresses this dilemma through the rearrangement of carbonate
               system equations which revealed an important proportionality
               between [CO32−] or $\Omega$CaCO3and the ratio of [HCO3−] to
               [H+]. Due to this proportionality, calcification rates will
               always correlate as well with [HCO3−] / [H+] as they do with
               [CO32−] or $\Omega$CaCO3 when temperature, salinity, and
               pressure are constant. Hence, [CO32−] and $\Omega$CaCO3 may
               simply be very good proxies for the control by [HCO3−] / [H+],
               where [HCO3−] serves as the inorganic carbon substrate and [H+]
               functions as a calcification inhibitor. If the

  abstract  = "Abstract. In order to fully constrain paleo-carbonate systems,
               proxies for two out of seven parameters, plus temperature and
               salinity, are required. The boron isotopic composition
               ($\delta$11B) of planktonic foraminifera shells is a powerful
               tool for reconstructing changes in past surface ocean pH. As
               B(OH)4− is substituted into the biogenic calcite lattice in
               place of CO32−, and both borate and carbonate ions are more
               abundant at higher pH, it was suggested early on that B ∕ Ca
               ratios in biogenic calcite may serve as a proxy for [CO32−].
               Although several recent studies have shown that a direct
               connection of B ∕ Ca to carbonate system parameters may be
               masked by other environmental factors in the field, there is
               ample evidence for a mechanistic relationship between B ∕ Ca and
               carbonate system parameters. Here, we focus on investigating the
               primary relationship to develop a mechanistic understanding of
               boron uptake. Differentiating between the effects of pH and
               [CO32−] is problematic, as they co-vary closely in natural
               systems, so the major control on boron incorporation remains
               unclear. To deconvolve the effects of pH and [CO32−] and to
               investigate their impact on the B ∕ Ca ratio and $\delta$11B, we
               conducted culture experiments with the planktonic foraminifer
               Orbulina universa in manipulated culture media: constant pH
               (8.05), but changing [CO32−] (238, 286 and 534 µmol kg−1 CO32−)
               and at constant [CO32−] (276 $\pm$ 19.5 µmol kg−1) and varying
               pH (7.7, 7.9 and 8.05). Measurements of the isotopic composition
               of boron and the B ∕ Ca ratio were performed simultaneously
               using a femtosecond laser ablation system coupled to a MC-ICP-MS
               (multiple-collector inductively coupled plasma mass
               spectrometer). Our results show that, as expected, $\delta$11B
               is controlled by pH but it is also modulated by [CO32−]. On the
               other hand, the B ∕ Ca ratio is driven by [HCO3−], independently
               of pH. This suggests that B ∕ Ca ratios in foraminiferal calcite
               can possibly be used as a second, independent, proxy for
               complete paleo-carbonate system reconstructions. This is
               discussed in light of recent literature demonstrating that the
               primary relationship between B ∕ Ca and [HCO3−] can be obscured
               by other environmental parameters.",

               for monitoring past changes in seawater pH and carbonate
               chemistry. However, a number of assumptions regarding chemical
               kinetics and thermodynamic isotope exchange reactions are
               required to derive seawater pH from $\delta$11B biogenic
               carbonates. It is also probable that $\delta$11B of biogenic
               carbonate reflects seawater pH at the organism's site of
               calcification, which may or may not reflect seawater pH. Here,
               we report the development of methodology for measuring the
               $\delta$11B of biogenic carbonate samples at the multi-collector
               inductively coupled mass spectrometry facility at Ifremer

               days in isothermal seawater (25 °C) equilibrated with an
               atmospheric pCO2 of ca. 409 µatm. Average $\delta$11BCaCO3
               composition for all species evaluated in this study range from
               16.27 to 35.09 ‰, including, in decreasing order, coralline red

               tribuloides (18.71 $\pm$ 0.26 ‰), temperate urchin Arbacia
               punctulata (16.28 $\pm$ 0.86 ‰), and temperate oyster
               Crassostrea virginica (16.03 ‰). These results are discussed in
               the context of each species' proposed mechanism of
               biocalcification and other factors that could influence skeletal
               and shell $\delta$11B, including calcifying site pH, the
               proposed direct incorporation of isotopically enriched boric
               acid (instead of borate) into biogenic calcium carbonate, and
               differences in shell/skeleton polymorph mineralogy. We conclude
               that the large inter-species variability in $\delta$11BCaCO3
               (ca. 20 ‰) and significant discrepancies between measured

               potential utility of $\delta$11B as a proxy of calcifying site

               past deep-water pH. As the abundance of monospecific species
               might be limited in sediments, microanalytical techniques can
               help to overcome this problem, but such studies on benthic
               foraminiferal $\delta$11B are sparse. In addition,
               microanalytics provide information on the distribution of
               $\delta$11B at high spatial resolution to increase the knowledge
               of biomineralization processes, for example. For this study, we
               investigated the intra- and inter-shell $\delta$11B variability
               of the epibenthic species Cibicidoides wuellerstorfi, which is
               widely used in paleoceanography, by secondary ion mass
               spectrometry (SIMS) and femtosecond laser ablation
               multicollector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry
               (LA-MC-ICPMS). While the average $\delta$11B values obtained
               from these different techniques agree remarkably well with bulk
               solution values to within $\pm$0.1 ‰, a relatively large
               intra-shell variability was observed. Based on multiple
               measurements within single shells, the SIMS and LA data suggest
               median variations of 4.8 ‰ and 1.3 ‰ (2$\sigma$), respectively,
               while the larger spread for SIMS is attributed to the smaller
               volume of calcite being analyzed in each run. When analytical
               uncertainties and volume-dependent differences in $\delta$11B
               variations are taken into account for these methods, the
               intra-shell variability is estimated to be on the order of ∼3 ‰
               and ∼0.4 ‰ (2$\sigma$) on a ∼20 and 100 µm scale, respectively.
               In comparison, the $\delta$11B variability between shells
               exhibits a total range of ∼3 ‰ for both techniques, suggesting
               that several shells need to be analyzed for accurate mean
               $\delta$11B values. Based on a simple resampling method, we
               conclude that ∼12 shells of C. wuellerstorfi must be analyzed
               using LA-MC-ICPMS to obtain an accurate average value within
               $\pm$0.5 ‰ (2$\sigma$) to resolve pH variations of ∼0.1. Based
               on our findings, we suggest preferring the conventional bulk
               solution MC-ICPMS over the in situ methods for paleo-pH studies,
               for example. However, SIMS and LA provide powerful tools for
               high-resolution paleoreconstructions, or for investigating
               ontogenetic trends in $\delta$11B.",

               purposeful experiments have only been carried out in the late
               1990s. The potentially dire consequences of ocean acidification
               attract scientists and students with a limited knowledge of the
               carbonate chemistry and its experimental manipulation. Hence,

               into the calcite of the specimens exposed to the highest
               elemental concentrations. Mn incorporation exhibited large
               variability in the experiment with the 20-fold increased element
               concentrations, potentially due to antagonistic effects with Cu.
               The partition coefficients of Cu and Ni were calculated to be
               0.14 $\pm$ 0.02 and 1.0 $\pm$ 0.5, respectively, whereas the
               partition coefficient of Mn was estimated to be least 2.4. These
               partition coefficients now open the way for reconstructing past
               concentrations for these elements in sea water.",

               carbon dioxide, especially in the surface ocean and its
               associated impacts on calcifying organisms, is accumulating.
               Among these organisms, benthic and planktonic foraminifera are
               responsible for a large amount of the globally precipitated
               calcium carbonate. Hence, their response to an acidifying ocean
               may have important consequences for future inorganic carbon
               cycling. To assess the sensitivity of benthic foraminifera to
               changing carbon dioxide levels and subsequent alteration in
               seawater carbonate chemistry, we cultured specimens of the
               shallow water species Ammonia tepida at two concentrations of
               atmospheric CO2 (230 and 1900 ppmv) and two temperatures (10 °C
               and 15 °C). Shell weights and elemental compositions were
               determined. Impact of high and low pCO2 on elemental composition
               are compared with results of a previous experiment were
               specimens were grown under ambient conditions (380 ppvm, no
               shell weight measurements of specimen grown under ambient
               conditions are, however, available). Results indicate that shell
               weights decrease with decreasing [CO32−], although calcification
               was observed even in the presence of calcium carbonate
               under-saturation, and also decrease with increasing temperature.
               Thus both warming and ocean acidification may act to decrease
               shell weights in the future. Changes in [CO32−] or total
               dissolved inorganic carbon do not affect the Mg distribution
               coefficient. On the contrary, Sr incorporation is enhanced under
               increasing [CO32−]. Implications of these results for the
               paleoceanographic application of foraminifera are discussed.",

               synthesis effort providing regular compilations of
               surface-to-bottom ocean biogeochemical data, with an emphasis on
               seawater inorganic carbon chemistry and related variables
               determined through chemical analysis of seawater samples.
               GLODAPv2.2020 is an update of the previous version,
               GLODAPv2.2019. The major changes are data from 106 new cruises
               added, extension of time coverage to 2019, and the inclusion of
               available (also for historical cruises) discrete fugacity of CO2
               (fCO2) values in the merged product files. GLODAPv2.2020 now
               includes measurements from more than 1.2 million water samples
               from the global oceans collected on 946 cruises. The data for
               the 12 GLODAP core variables (salinity, oxygen, nitrate,
               silicate, phosphate, dissolved inorganic carbon, total
               alkalinity, pH, CFC-11, CFC-12, CFC-113, and CCl4) have
               undergone extensive quality control with a focus on systematic
               evaluation of bias. The data are available in two formats: (i)
               as submitted by the data originator but updated to WOCE exchange
               format and (ii) as a merged data product with adjustments
               applied to minimize bias. These adjustments were derived by
               comparing the data from the 106 new cruises with the data from
               the 840 quality-controlled cruises of the GLODAPv2.2019 data
               product using crossover analysis. Comparisons to empirical
               algorithm estimates provided additional context for adjustment
               decisions; this is new to this version. The adjustments are
               intended to remove potential biases from errors related to
               measurement, calibration, and data-handling practices without
               removing known or likely time trends or variations in the
               variables evaluated. The compiled and adjusted data product is
               believed to be consistent to better than 0.005 in salinity, 1 \%
               in oxygen, 2 \% in nitrate, 2 \% in silicate, 2 \% in phosphate,
               4 µmol kg−1 in dissolved inorganic carbon, 4 µmol kg−1 in total
               alkalinity, 0.01--0.02 in pH (depending on region), and 5 \% in
               the halogenated transient tracers. The other variables included
               in the compilation, such as isotopic tracers and discrete fCO2,
               were not subjected to bias comparison or adjustments. The

               Version 3 of SOCAT has 14.7 million fCO2 values from 3646 data
               sets covering the years 1957 to 2014. This latest version has an
               additional 4.6 million fCO2 values relative to version 2 and
               extends the record from 2011 to 2014. Version 3 also
               significantly increases the data availability for 2005 to 2013.
               SOCAT has an average of approximately 1.2 million surface water
               fCO2 values per year for the years 2006 to 2012. Quality and
               documentation of the data has improved. A new feature is the

               alternative sensors and platforms. The accuracy of surface water
               fCO2 has been defined for all data set QC flags. Automated range

               gateway for nutrients and pollutants from land to sea. While
               understanding SGD is crucial for managing nearshore ecosystems
               and coastal freshwater reserves, studying this discharge is
               complicated by its occurrence at the limit between land and sea,
               a dynamic environment. This practical difficulty is exacerbated
               by the significant spatial and temporal variability. Therefore,
               to capture the magnitude of SGD, a variety of techniques and
               measurements, applied over multiple periods, is needed. Here, we
               combine several geophysical methods to detect zones of fresh
               submarine groundwater discharge (FSGD) in the intertidal zone,
               upper beach, dunes, and shallow coastal area. Both terrestrial
               electrical-resistivity tomography (ERT; roll-along) and marine
               continuous resistivity profiling (CRP) are used from the shallow
               continental shelf up to the dunes and combined with frequency
               domain electromagnetic (FDEM) mapping in the intertidal zone. In
               particular, we apply an estimation of robust apparent electrical
               conductivity (rECa) from FDEM data to provide reliable lateral
               and vertical discrimination of FSGD zones. The study area is a
               very dynamic environment along the North Sea, characterized by
               semi-diurnal tides between 3 and 5 m. CRP is usually applied in
               calmer conditions, but we prove that such surveys are possible
               and provide additional information to primarily land-bound ERT
               surveying. The 2D inversion models created from ERT and CRP data
               clearly indicate the presence of FSGD on the lower beach or
               below the low-water line. This discharge originates from a
               potable freshwater lens below the dunes and flows underneath a
               thick saltwater lens, present from the dunes to the lower sandy
               beach, which is fully observed with ERT. Freshwater outflow
               intensity has increased since 1980, due to a decrease of
               groundwater pumping in the dunes. FDEM mapping at two different
               times reveals discharge at the same locations, clearly displays
               the lateral variation of the zone of discharge, and suggests
               that FSGD is stronger at the end of winter compared to the
               beginning of autumn. ERT, CRP, and FDEM are complementary tools
               in the investigation of SGD. They provide a high-resolution 3D
               image of the saltwater and freshwater distribution in the
               phreatic coastal aquifer over a relatively large area, both off-

               Boundary Layer Limitation of Proton Flux",
  author    = "Jokiel, Paul Louis",
  abstract  = "Since the beginning of the industrial revolution, the
               concentration of atmospheric CO2 has been rising due to the
               burning of fossil fuels. increased absorption of this CO2 by the
               oceans is lowering the seawater pH and aragonite saturation
               state (ar). This process is known as ocean acidification (OA).
               numerous studies have shown a direct correlation between
               declining ocean pH, declining ar, and declining coral growth,
               but the mechanism is not understood. Various experiments
               designed to evaluate the relative importance of pH, CO3 2, ar,
               HCO3 , aqueous CO2, total alkalinity, and total inorganic carbon
               (Ct) to coral calcification have led to opposing conclusions. A
               reanalysis of existing data suggests that the mechanism is
               diffusion limitation of net H+ transport through the boundary
               layer caused by increasing [H+] in the water column. The
               resulting proton flux hypothesis offers an explanation for the
               reduction in calcification caused by OA and other phenomena
               associated with increasing acidification. The hypothesis states

               significance testing (NHST) continues to be applied
               ritualistically and mindlessly. This dogma is based on
               superficial understanding of elementary notions of frequentist
               statistics in the 1930s, and is widely disseminated by
               influential textbooks targeted at biologists. It is
               characterized by silly null hypotheses and mechanical
               dichotomous division of results being ``significant'' (P < 0.05)
               or not. Simple examples are given to demonstrate how distant the
               prevalent NHST malpractice is from the current mainstream
               practice of professional statisticians. Masses of trivial and
               meaningless ``results'' are being reported, which are not
               providing adequate quantitative information of scientific
               interest. The NHST dogma also retards progress in the
               understanding of ecological systems and the effects of
               management programmes, which may at worst contribute to damaging
               decisions in conservation biology. In the beginning of this
               millennium, critical discussion and debate on the problems and
               shortcomings of NHST has intensified in ecological journals.
               Alternative approaches, like basic point and interval estimation
               of effect sizes, likelihood-based and information theoretic
               methods, and the Bayesian inferential paradigm, have started to

               training them to utilize appropriately the expanded statistical
               toolbox. Ecologists should finally abandon the false doctrines
               and textbooks of their previous statistical gurus. Instead they
               should more carefully learn what leading statisticians write and
               say, collaborate with statisticians in teaching, research, and

  title    = "Assessing foraminifera biomineralisation models through trace
              element data of cultures under variable seawater chemistry",
  abstract = "The process by which foraminifera precipitate calcite from
              seawater has received much attention, in part because a
              mechanistic basis for empirical calibrations between shell
              chemistry and environmental parameters is desirable given their
              widespread application in palaeoceanography. The incorporation of
              fluorescent membrane-impermeable molecules into the shell
              demonstrates that seawater, transported by vacuolisation, is
              present at the site of calcification. However, recent discussion
              has focused on whether the calcium required for chamber formation
              is sourced predominantly by transmembrane Ca transport (TMT),
              with seawater vacuolisation playing a passive role, or vice
              versa. This debate has arisen in part because of the need to
              explain the low Mg/Ca ratio of most foraminifera compared to
              inorganic calcite. Here, we present trace element data of
              Operculina ammonoides and Globigerinoides ruber, a high-Mg
              shallow benthic, and low-Mg planktonic species respectively,
              cultured under variable seawater carbonate and elemental
              chemistries. We find that Mg incorporation in high and low-Mg
              species is characterised by an opposite response to the carbonate
              system, demonstrating that the negative relationship between
              Mg/Ca and pH or [ CO 3 2 - ] in several low-Mg foraminifera is
              not an intrinsic feature of foraminiferal (or inorganic) calcite
              precipitation. Therefore, any biomineralisation model must be
              able to explain why the mechanism by which seawater Mg/Ca is
              reduced is impacted by the carbonate system. Moreover, we show
              that trace element incorporation in G. ruber is consistent with
              Rayleigh fractionation from unmodified seawater except for
              Mg-removal, but in very poor agreement with a biomineralisation
              site [Ca] substantially elevated above that of seawater as
              required by the TMT hypothesis. In addition, any
              biomineralisation model must explain the nonlinear relationship
              between seawater and shell Mg/Ca, and the large number of
              seawater vacuoles observed in some species. Although there are
              important inter-species differences in biomineralisation, evident
              from the observed range of shell Mg/Ca ratios, we argue that
              these differences are mechanistically related to the degree of Mg
              exclusion prior to chamber formation. Indeed, whilst our data for
              both low-Mg and high-Mg species are consistent with
              biomineralisation via ions sourced through seawater
              vacuolisation, it is difficult to reconcile many of these
              observations with a model based on significant transmembrane Ca
              transport.",

              formation of nitrogen-fixing heterocysts and boron may be
              beneficial to animals. Boron deficiency in plants produces
              manifold symptoms: many functions have been postulated.
              Deficiency symptoms first appear at growing points, within hours
              in root tips and within minutes or seconds in pollen tube tips,
              and are characterized by cell wall abnormalities. Boron-deficient
              tissues are brittle or fragile, while plants grown on high boron
              levels may have unusually flexible or resilient tissues. Borate
              forms cyclic diesters with appropriate diols or polyols. The most
              stable are formed with cis-diols on a furanoid ring. Two
              compounds have this structure physiologically: ribose in
              ribonucleotides and RNA, and apiose in the plant cell wall.
              Germanium can substitute for boron in carrot cell cultures. Both
              boron and germanium are localized primarily in the cell wall. We
              postulate that borate-apiofuranose ester cross-links are the
              auxin-sensitive acid-growth link in vascular plants, that the
              cyanobacterial heterocyst envelope depends on borate
              cross-linking of mannopyranose and/or galactopyranose residues in
              a polysaccharide-lipid environment, and that boron in diatoms

  abstract    = "Environmental protection policies in the automobile market
                 were not implemented until the motorisation of the masses in
                 the 1960s caused an increasing environmental burden. The
                 rising air pollution was considered a latent danger for
                 humans, animals and plants. In the years up to 1985 the EU
                 passed several regulations to limit the mass pollutants CO,
                 CxHy and NOx. Germany was the first EU-member nation to also
                 be concerned with lead in gasoline, passing reduction
                 regulations as early as in 1971. In 1986, several EU-member
                 nations implemented the supply of unleaded gasoline. This
                 decision was predominantly based on information about
                 widespread forest damage. The reduction of lead emissions due
                 to these regulations could be verified in different
                 environmental systems. An example of this was the decline of
                 atmospheric lead concentrations and human blood lead levels in
                 Germany. The German mineral oil and automobile markets were
                 also affected. The price trend of unleaded fuel was heavily
                 influenced by tax incentives which benefited not only the
                 gasoline traders but also the consumers. With regard to the
                 distribution system, the market positions particularly of the
                 medium-sized traders and the independent importers were
                 weakened. In the automobile market, favourable terms of
                 competition were experienced by producers who had already
                 gained experience with catalyst systems in the U.S.-market.
                 The gasoline lead content regulations had no effects on
                 further economic indicators, except for competition. (orig.)
                 [German] Infolge der Massenmotorisierung in den 60er Jahren
                 stieg die Umweltbelastung durch den Automobilverkehr stark an.
                 Luftverschmutzung durch Kraftfahrzeuge wurde erstmalig als
                 latente Gefahr fuer die Gesundheit von Mensch, Tier und
                 Pflanze wahrgenommen. Dies charakterisierte den Beginn der
                 Umweltpolitik im Automobilsektor. Bis 1985 verabschiedete die
                 Europaeische Union (EU) mehrere Rahmenrichtlinien zur
                 Reduktion der Luftschadstoffe CO, CxHy und NOx. 1971 war
                 Deutschland das erste europaeische Land, das Gesetze zur
                 Reduktion des Bleigehalts in Benzin erliess. Vor dem
                 Hintergrund der Diskussion um die Gefahr des Waldsterbens
                 wurde seit 1985 nicht nur in Deutschland, sondern ab 1986 auch
                 in einigen anderen Laendern der EU bleifreies Benzin
                 angeboten. Mit zeitlicher Verzoegerung fuehrten diese
                 gesetzlichen Massnahmen zur Reduktion der Bleikonzentrationen
                 in verschiedenen Umweltmedien, wie z.B. in der Atmosphaere
                 oder auch im Menschen. Oekonomische Auswirkungen hatte die
                 Bleireduktion im Benzin in Deutschland vor allem auf die
                 Mineraloel- und Automobilindustrie. Dabei war die
                 Preisentwicklung fuer bleifreies Benzin durch steuerliche
                 Anreize stark beeinflusst, die nicht nur den Handel, sondern
                 auch die Autofahrer beguenstigte. Im Automobilsektor
                 profitierten vorwiegend die Hersteller, die bereits durch
                 Exporte auf den US-Markt Erfahrungen mit abgasarmen Techniken,
                 wie z.B. dem Katalysator, gesammelt hatten. Abgesehen vom
                 Wettbewerb, hatte die Bleigesetzgebung jedoch keinen Einfluss
                 auf volkswirtschaftliche Indikatoren. (orig.)",

               in the Cambrian (Erwin and Signor 1991; Tracey et al. 1993),
               gastropods have come to inhabit nearly all marine , freshwater,
               and terrestrial habitats and have achieved a diversity at all
               taxo-nomic levels that is exceeded only by the Insecta. Because
               of their long and extensive fossil record, Gastropoda have
               figured prominently in paleontologi-cal studies spanning the
               entire Phanerozoic. By virtue of their abundance and diversity
               in the Recent fauna, gastropods have been used in studies
               spanning numerous biological disciplines, including ecology,
               physiology, developmental biology, population genetics,
               biodiversity, biomechanics, biogeography, and molecular
               evolution. Gastropods are also of considerable economic
               importance as sources of food, ornament, and pharmacological
               compounds, and as agricultural and mariculture pests and vectors
               of disease (see Cheng 1967; Faust et al. 1968; Abbott 1972;
               Olivera 1997, and references therein). The higher classification
               of gastropods had become entrenched for much of the twentieth
               century, being based on an arrangement advanced by Thiele
               (1929-31) and only slightly modified by subsequent authors (Wenz
               1938-44; Moore 1960; Boss 1982; Brusca and Brusca 1990). Thiele
               (1929-31) adopted Milne-Edwards's (1848) division of Gastropoda
               into Prosobranchia, Opistho-branchia, and Pulmonata, but further
               subdivided the Prosobranchia into the ana-genic series

  abstract  = "The ocean helps moderate climate change thanks to its
               considerable capacity to store CO2, through the combined actions
               of ocean physics, chemistry, and biology. This storage capacity
               limits the amount of human-released CO2 remaining in the
               atmosphere. As CO2 reacts with seawater, it generates dramatic
               changes in carbonate chemistry, including decreases in pH and
               carbonate ions and an increase in bicarbonate ions. The
               consequences of this overall process, known as ``ocean
               acidification'', are raising concerns for the biological,
               ecological, and biogeochemical health of the world's oceans, as
               well as for the potential societal implications. This research
               level text is the first to synthesize the very latest
               understanding of the consequences of ocean acidification, with
               the intention of informing both future research agendas and
               marine management policy. A prestigious list of authors has been
               assembled, among them the coordinators of major national and
               international projects on ocean acidification.",

               seasonal changes in levels of ubiquitin conjugates and hsp70 in
               the intertidal mussel {\textit{Mytilus trossulus}}",

  abstract  = "We examined the seasonal variation in environmentally induced
               protein damage in natural populations of the intertidal mussel
               Mytilus trossulus. In order to compare the state of protein
               pools during seasonal variations in environmental temperature,
               we used solid-phase immunochemical analysis to quantify
               ubiquitin conjugate concentrations and relative levels of the
               stress protein hsp70. The two biochemical indices were selected
               for their cellular roles in irreversible and reversible protein
               denaturation, respectively. Proteins that are ubiquitinated are
               irreversibly damaged and are degraded by intracellular
               proteases; stress proteins act as molecular chaperones to
               re-fold thermally denatured proteins and, thus, indicate degrees
               of reversible protein damage. Comparisons involved mussels
               collected in February and August from two study sites: an
               intertidal site which subjected animals to a wide range of body
               temperatures (from approximately 10 to 35 C in summer), and a
               subtidal site where animals remained submerged throughout the
               tidal cycle. Our results show that quantities of ubiquitin
               conjugates and hsp70 were greater in gill tissue from
               summer-collected mussels than in gills of winter-collected
               specimens. Ubiquitin conjugate and hsp70 levels were also
               greater in mussels collected from an intertidal location than in
               mussels from a submerged population. Our results show that the
               high summer temperatures normally experienced in the field are
               sufficient to cause increased denaturation of cellular proteins.
               Despite increases in the concentrations of heat shock proteins
               in summer-acclimatized mussels, elevated levels of irreversibly
               denatured, i.e. ubiquitinated, proteins were still observed,
               which indicates that the heat shock response may not be able to
               rescue all heat-damaged proteins. The energy costs associated
               with replacing heat-damaged proteins and with maintaining the
               concentrations and activities of heat shock proteins may
               contribute substantially to cellular energy demands. These
               increased energy demands may have an impact on the ecological
               energetic relationships of species, e.g. in the allocations of
               energy for growth and reproduction, and, as a consequence, may
               contribute to determining their distribution limits.",

  abstract = "Temporal and spatial patterns of phenotypic variation have
              traditionally been thought to reflect genetic differentiation
              produced by natural selection. Recently, however, there has been
              growing interest in how natural selection may shape the genetics
              of phenotypic plasticity to produce patterns of geographic
              variation and phenotypic evolution. Because the covariance
              between genetic and environmental influences can modulate the
              expression of phenotypic variation, a complete understanding of
              geographic variation requires determining whether these
              influences covary in the same (cogradient variation) or in
              opposing (countergradient variation) directions. We focus on
              marine snails from rocky intertidal shores as an ideal system to
              explore how genetic and plastic influences contribute to
              geographic and historical patterns of phenotypic variation.
              Phenotypic plasticity in response to predator cues, wave action,
              and water temperature appear to exert a strong influence on small
              and large-scale morphological variation in marine snails. In
              particular, plasticity in snail shell thickness: (i) may
              contribute to phenotypic evolution, (ii) appears to have evolved
              across small and large spatial scales, and (iii) may be driven by
              life history trade-offs tied to architectural constraints imposed
              by the shell. The plasticity exhibited by these snails represents
              an important adaptive strategy to the pronounced heterogeneity of
              the intertidal zone and undoubtedly has played a key role in
              their evolution.",

              porites) [2] and JCt-1 (Giant Clam) [3]. This boron isotope
              interlaboratory comparison study has two aims: (i) to assess to
              what extent chemical pre-treatment, aimed at removing organic
              material, can influence the resulting carbonate $\delta$11B; (ii)
              to determine the isotopic composition of the two reference
              materials with a number of analytical techniques to provide the
              community with reference $\delta$11B values for JCp-1 and JCt-1
              and to further explore any differences related to analytical
              technique. In total eight isotope laboratories participated, of
              which one determined $\delta$11B via negative thermal ionisation
              mass spectrometry (NTIMS) and seven used multi collector
              inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC-ICPMS). For the
              latter several different introduction systems and chemical
              purification methods were used. Overall the results are
              strikingly consistent between the participating labs. The
              oxidation of organic material slightly lowered the median
              $\delta$11B by ~0.1 ‰ for both JCp-1 and JCt-1, while the mean
              $\delta$11B of all labs for both standards was lowered by 0.20 ‰
              for JCp-1 and 0.15 ‰ for JCt-1, hence within uncertainty of the
              reported values. With the exception of one MC-ICPMS lab that
              provided significantly lower JCp-1 $\delta$11B data for
              unoxidised material (1.7 ‰ below median), the remaining JCp-1
              results reproduced within $\pm$ 0.54 ‰ for unoxidised (n=21) and
              $\pm$ 0.37 ‰ for oxidised standards (n=21). The JCt-1 standards
              did not reproduce as well, resulting in a 2 s.d. of 1.0 ‰ for
              both unoxidised and oxidised powders (n=21) and in places the
              effect of oxidation appeared to be laboratory dependent.
              Exclusion of one MC-ICPMS lab resulted in an improved
              reproducibility of 0.52 ‰ (n=18) for oxidised JCt-1 material. The
              mean difference for the two standard materials in the respective
              labs (i.e., ∆$\delta$11B = mean $\delta$11B(JCp-1) - mean
              $\delta$11B(JCt-1)) was 7.9 $\pm$ 0.9 ‰ for unoxidised (n=7) and
              8.1 $\pm$ 0.7 ‰ for oxidised standards (n=7). In this
              presentation emphasis will also be placed on distinguishing
              factors leading to increased/decreased interlaboratory
              consistency during the preparation and analysis of biogenic
              carbonates for other isotopic systems. References [1] Foster,

              probe the uptake of Ca2+ in foraminifera shells grown via live
              culturing. This technique is based on the addition of the minor
              stable isotope W a (natural abun-dance 0.19\%) to seawater. The
              extent of CaZ+ uptake by foraminifera can be assessed by
              determination of the 48/44Ca of the cultured shells using plasma
              mass spec-trometry. This new technique could also be used to
              as-sess Ca2-uptake in other CaC0,-secreting organisms. Results
              from labeling experiments indicate that almost all the CaZ-in the
              terminal spherical chamber of the planktonic foraminifer Orbulina
              universa is in isotopic equilibrium with the surrounding
              seawater. Only a very small fraction (<0.15 pg CaCO, equivalent,
              or 0.5\% of average final shell mass) is likely to come from some
              other pool. If our results apply generally to the precip-itation
              of foraminifera shells, they suggest that an inter-nal
              cytoplasmic Ca2+ pool probably does not provide a means by which
              seawater cation ratios can be fraction-ated. We have also applied
              the new labeling technique to the determination of incremental
              calcification rates in Orbulina universa. Our results indicate
              that adult cal-cification in individuals grown under high light
              is up to three times greater than for individuals grown in the
              dark. This difference is directly attributable to the role
              symbionts play in enhancing calcification. The enhance-ment in
              calcification rate is close to the calculated in-crease in
              carbonate ion due to the photosynthetic activity of the
              symbionts, suggesting that calcification rate in 0. universa is
              proportional to the degree of carbonate sat-uration.",

               trophic relations, community structure, and the dynamic
               interaction of living things with the physical environment. Not

               abundant and/or larger members of the plankton community,

               nonthecate algae, and flagellates, or the major con

               influence of both temperature and nutrient concentration
               ([PO43?]) on foraminiferal calcification and growth. The
               presence of two G.?bulloides morphospecies with systematically
               different calcification properties and offset stable isotopic
               compositions was identified within sampling populations using
               distinguishing morphometric characteristics. The calcification
               temperature and by extension calcification depth of the more
               abundant ?normal? G.?bulloides morphospecies was determined
               using $\delta$18O temperature estimates. Calcification depths
               vary seasonally with upwelling and were used to select the
               appropriate [CO32?], temperature, and [PO43?] depth measurements
               for comparison with area density. Seasonal upwelling in the
               study region also results in collinearity between independent
               variables complicating a straightforward statistical analysis.
               To address this issue, we use additional statistical diagnostics
               and a down core record to disentangle the respective roles of
               each parameter on G.?bulloides calcification. Our results

              effects of multiple environmental drivers to the emergent impacts
              on ecosystems is a fundamental challenge. Unfortunately, the
              disconnect between the way ``stressors'' (e.g., warming) is
              considered in organismal (physiological) and ecological
              (community) contexts continues to hamper progress. Environmental
              drivers typically elicit biphasic physiological responses, where
              performance declines at levels above and below some optimum. It
              is also well understood that species exhibit highly variable
              response surfaces to these changes so that the optimum level of
              any environmental driver can vary among interacting species.
              Thus, species interactions are unlikely to go unaltered under
              environmental change. However, while these nonlinear,
              species-specific physiological relationships between environment
              and performance appear to be general, rarely are they
              incorporated into predictions of ecological tipping points.
              Instead, most ecosystem-level studies focus on varying levels of
              ``stress'' and frequently assume that any deviation from
              ``normal'' environmental conditions has similar effects, albeit
              with different magnitudes, on all of the species within a
              community. We consider a framework that realigns the positive and
              negative physiological effects of changes in climatic and
              nonclimatic drivers with indirect ecological responses. Using a
              series of simple models based on direct physiological responses
              to temperature and ocean pCO 2, we explore how variation in
              environment-performance relationships among primary producers and
              consumers translates into community-level effects via trophic
              interactions. These models show that even in the absence of
              direct mortality, mismatched responses resulting from often
              subtle changes in the physical environment can lead to

               on Chl. The de-eutrophication process, detectable in the
               reduction of nutrient river loads to the sea, caused a decrease
               of nutrient concentrations in coastal waters under riverine
               influence. A decline in annual mean Chl was observed at 11 out
               of 18 sampling sites (coastal and offshore) in the period
               1988?2016. Also, a shift in Chl phenology was observed around
               2000, with spring bloom formation occurring earlier in the year.
               A long time series of pH in the Southern North Sea showed an
               increase until the mid-1980s followed by a rapid decrease,
               suggesting changes in phytoplankton production that would
               support the observed changes in Chl. Linear correlations,
               however, did not reveal significant relationships between Chl
               variability and winter nutrients or SST at the sampling sites.
               We propose that the observed changes in Chl (annual or seasonal)
               around 2000 are a response of phytoplankton dynamics to multiple
               stressors, directly or indirectly influenced by
               de-eutrophication and climate warming.",

               (s) is mainly controlled by seawater B(OH)4?/HCO3? with a
               roughly constant partition coefficient of 1.48?$\pm$?0.15???10?3
               (2$\sigma$), and $\delta$11B in this species is offset below
               $\delta$11B of the borate in seawater by 3.38?$\pm$?0.71?
               (2$\sigma$). These values represent our best estimates with the
               sparse available hydrographic data close to our core-tops. More
               culturing and sediment trap work is needed to improve our
               understanding of boron incorporation into N. pachyderma (s).
               Application of a constant KD of 1.48???10?3 to high resolution
               N. pachyderma (s) B/Ca records from two adjacent cores off
               Iceland shows that subsurface pCO2 at the habitat depth of N.
               pachyderma (s) (~50 m) generally followed the atmospheric CO2
               trend but with negative offsets of ~10?50 ppmv during 19?10 ka.
               These B/Ca-based reconstructions are supported by independent
               estimates from low-resolution $\delta$11B measurements in the
               same cores. We also calibrate and apply Cd/Ca in N. pachyderma
               (s) to reconstruct nutrient levels for the same down cores. Like
               today's North Atlantic, past subsurface pCO2 variability off
               Iceland was significantly correlated with nutrient changes that
               might be linked to surface nutrient utilization and mixing
               within the upper water column. Because surface pCO2 (at 0 m
               water depth) is always lower than at deeper depths and if the
               application of a constant KD is valid, our results suggest that

              spectrometry (LA-MC-ICP-MS) offers the potential for rapid sample
              throughput, and the means to examine micron-scale variations in
              the $\delta$11 B signatures of fossil skeletons and shells/tests
              of marine organisms. Existing studies demonstrate an acceptable
              level of reproducibility is achievable, but also typically show a
              level of accuracy outside the limits required by most
              applications. Here we investigate matrix interference effects as
              a cause of inaccuracy and imprecision. METHODS: Analyses were
              performed on a standard format Thermo Scientific Neptune Plus
              MC-ICP mass spectrometer coupled to a New Wave Research 193 nm
              ArF laser ablation system. The effects of matrix interference on
              $\delta$11 B analysis were investigated through analyses of a set
              of reference materials with differing B/Ca ratios. Three
              approaches to correct for matrix-induced effects were trialled:
              (1) use of matrix-matched standards, (2) utilisation of the
              relationship between $\delta$11 B inaccuracy and11 B/43 Ca, 11
              B/40 ArCa4+ or 11 B/Cainterference from three reference materials
              with known $\delta$11 B values and varying B/Ca ratios, and (3)
              direct characterisation of the (sloping) interference itself.
              RESULTS: Matrix interference from scattered Ca ions on 10 B can
              impede both the accuracy and the reproducibility of $\delta$11 B
              analysis by LA-MC-ICP-MS. Based on analyses of two in-house
              reference materials, deep sea coral PS69/3181 and inorganic
              calcite UWC-1, we find approach 2, following the 11
              B/Cainterference relationship, gives the best mean accuracies
              (within 0.4‰ of solution values) and external reproducibilities
              ($\pm$ 0.5‰ 2 SD for PS69/3181). This approach has been applied
              to analyses of an annual growth cycle of a Siderastrea siderea

              Both coral and foraminifera data match solution MC-ICP-MS

  abstract  = "Abstract Climate and weather extremes are sporadically recurring
               events that may have major local or regional impacts on the
               society and the environment. These events are typically related
               to unusually high or low temperature, prolonged dry or wet
               conditions, heavy precipitation, or extreme winds. Extreme
               events are part of the overall climate and weather alongside
               average conditions and variability, and thus are not unexpected
               as such. Climate change is expected to affect not only means but
               also variability and extremes. Some inferences can be based on
               past and present observations, but analyses of especially rare
               events are hampered by the availability of long time series.
               Over time, depending on how far the on-going global warming
               takes us from the present and the past climate conditions, the
               weather and climate statistics may well come to shift in ways
               that are well outside observational data. This may lead to
               shifts in frequency, intensity and geographical distribution of
               different extremes. Indeed, projected changes in some extremes
               over the 21st century are quite robust, such as generally
               increasing warm and decreasing cold extremes. Possible changes
               in some other aspects, for example storms, remain much more
               uncertain. Science-based information both on robust findings and
               on relevant uncertainties on changing extremes can provide

  abstract = "The spatial and temporal distribution of trace metals has been
              studied in sediments of the Scheldt estuary, in order to identify
              trends in space and time. Sediment trace metal data, obtained by
              11 laboratories, were considered for the period 1959--90. It was
              found that trace metal data obtained by complete sample digestion
              (e.g. HClO4-HF) were incomparable to those obtained by strong
              acid leaching (e.g. HNO3-HCl). However, various strong acid
              leaches were found to yield comparable results for sediment trace
              metals, except for chromium. Hence, trace metal data obtained by
              strong acid digestion could be merged into a comprehensive
              database (except for chromium), which was analysed by an ANOVA
              procedure. Sediment trace metal contents were normalized against
              a common standard, based on their grain size fraction and organic
              matter content. Spatial variations were investigated for four
              areas encompassing the entire Scheldt estuary within the periods
              1978--85 and 1986--90. For one specific area, mid-estuary, trace
              metal data were studied from 1959 to 1987. For each area and
              period considered, the sediment trace metal content was
              calculated at the average percentage <16$\mu$m and organic matter
              content of the whole data set. The results showed that: (1) The
              upper Scheldt estuary is strongly polluted by trace metals,
              especially cadmium; (2) Viewed in historic perspective, pollution
              of the Scheldt estuary by trace metals was maximal at the end of
              the 1950s but decreased considerably through the 1970s and again
              in the 1980s. Monitoring data of suspended matter composition and
              trace metal profiles in a radiodated sediment core tend to
              confirm this pollution history; (3) The trace metal content of
              the sediments decreases in the downstream direction due to mixing
              of metal-rich fluvial sediments and metal-poor marine sediments;
              (4) Although physical mixing is the most important process that
              controls the trace metal content of the sediments, evidence is
              presented for mobilization of cadmium with increasing salinity,

               the environment compared to inorganic substances, such as
               metals, one common feature is that for different reasons,
               sediments often act as a common sink. In this sense sites with a

               both the palaeo-environmental scientists and pollution
               scientists. Estuaries are often areas of significant deposition
               and are attractive to the historical study of anthropogenic
               inputs, however, sediments are also subject to a wide range of
               physicochemical conditions (from fresh to marine water) that
               fluctuate both in space and time. Changing water and sediment
               geochemistry influences metal binding capacity and flocculation
               of fine particles and for these reasons estuaries are
               challenging for the pollution scientist. However, methods of

               among species and even within the same species, precluding the
               drawing of a general picture. This is, however, not the case for
               pteropods, with all species tested so far, being negatively
               impacted by ocean acidification. The blood of shelled molluscs
               may exhibit lower pH with consequences for several physiological
               processes (e.g. respiration, excretion, etc.) and, in some
               cases, increased mortality in the long term. While fertilization
               may remain unaffected by elevated pCO2, embryonic and larval
               development will be highly sensitive with important reductions
               in size and decreased survival of larvae, increases in the
               number of abnormal larvae and an increase in the developmental
               time. There are big gaps in the current understanding of the
               biological consequences of an acidifying ocean on shelled
               molluscs. For instance, the natural variability of pH and the
               interactions of changes in the carbonate chemistry with changes
               in other environmental stressors such as increased temperature
               and changing salinity, the effects of species interactions, as
               well as the capacity of the organisms to acclimate and/or adapt
               to changing environmental conditions are poorly described.",

               surrounds the foraminiferal shell and limits the O2 and proton
               transport from the shell to the ambient seawater and vice versa.
               Due to symbiont photosynthesis, high O2 concentrations of up to
               206\% air saturation and a pH of up to 8.8, i.e. 0.5 pH units
               above ambient seawater, were measured at the shell surface of
               the foraminifer at saturating irradiances. The respiration of
               the host--symbiont system in darkness decreased the O2
               concentration at the shell surface to <70\% of the oxygen
               content in the surrounding air-saturated water. The pH at the
               shell surface dropped to 7.9 in darkness. We measured a mean
               gross photosynthetic rate of 8.5 $\pm$ 4.0 nmol O2 h−1
               foraminifer−1. The net photosynthesis averaged 5.3 $\pm$ 2.7

               rates were significantly lower (1.7 $\pm$ 0.7 nmol O2 h−1).
               Experimental light--dark cycles demonstrated a very dynamic
               response of the symbionts to changing light conditions. Gross
               photosynthesis versus scalar irradiance curves (P vs Eo curves)

              metal emissions from land-based sources have been reported
              between 1985 and 2000. Recently, some studies in the Western
              Scheldt estuary (WS) have shown that total metal concentration in
              the water, sediments and suspended particles have decreased
              compared to levels in the 70s. However, data on aquatic organisms
              is still very limited and it is therefore difficult to confirm
              whether the reductions in pollution input and generally improving
              water quality in the WS have a corresponding impact on the levels
              of heavy metals in aquatic organisms. The current study measured
              metal concentrations in the soft tissues of mussels, Mytilus
              edulis (known to be good indicators of environmental metal
              pollution) during the period 1996--2002. Spatial (salinity and
              pollution gradients), temporal and seasonal variations were also
              studied. Results showed a down-stream decreasing trend for the
              metals studied (Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn) during all
              sampling campaigns. There was also a significant seasonal effect
              on tissue metal concentrations, with a peak observed around
              spring in both WS and the nearby less polluted Eastern Scheldt
              (ES). On temporal trends, a clear drop of metals in mussels was
              observed in the early 80s coinciding with the start of the
              efforts to reduce chemical pollution input into the North Sea.
              Since those early reductions, metal concentrations in mussels
              generally remained unchanged upto mid 90s. However, in recent
              times metal concentration in mussels have increased
              significantly, for example Cd in 2002 was almost 10 times the
              values in 1983 and similar to levels seen during the peak in the
              70s. Other metals also increased in the 90s also reaching levels
              seen in the 70s. As there is no indication of recent increase in
              metal input into the estuary, we suggest that increased metal
              concentrations observed in mussels in recent years especially in
              the upper estuary are most likely a result of changes in physical
              and chemical speciation and metal bioavailability. Such changes
              may be caused by changes in some water quality parameters in the
              estuary (i.e. increased dissolved oxygen, concentration of
              organic matter), resulting in conditions that favour releases of
              sediment-bound metals into the water column. The relationship
              between metal content and season showed very similar annual
              profiles in the polluted WS and less polluted ES. Thus, seasonal
              variations in metal concentrations appear to be largely
              controlled by biological processes, while total body burdens are
              dependent on environmental levels and bioavailability.",

               availability of carbonate ions is remarkably low $\Omega$arag <
               0.5. Although these Mytilus grow in the intertidal zone, and
               therefore are covered by seawater during high tide, $\delta$18O
               isotopes of shell carbonate were low − 2.48 $\pm$ 0.05‰,
               confirming that their shells were deposited under low salinity
               conditions, i.e., reflecting a contribution from 18O-depleted
               freshwater. $\delta$18O isotopes of shell carbonate became
               heavier with increasing salinity, with mean values of − 0.74
               $\pm$ 0.96‰ for Mytilus growing in tidal pools. We calculated,
               based on $\delta$18O isotopic composition standardized to a
               common temperature, that freshwater accounted for 7\% of the
               carbonate oxygen in the shells of Mytilus at the habitats with
               near full-strength seawater salinity compared with 25\% in
               shells collected at sites temporarily exposed to freshwater. The
               composition of the periostracum revealed a trend for shells from
               river mouths and brackish tidal lagoons to be more depleted in
               polysaccharides than shells exposed to higher salinity. We
               conclude that the high food supply associated with riverine
               discharge allows Mytilus to cope with the low saturation states
               by using energy to calcify and modify their periostracum to
               protect the shells from dissolution. These findings suggest that
               Arctic Mytilus are highly resistant to low saturation states of

              using a positive ion (Cs2BO2+) TIMS technique and a chemical
              procedure for B extraction are reported. The $\delta$11B for
              modern corals fluctuates between 23.3 and 25.5‰. The range of
              variation of fossil corals from the last interglacial period is
              greater, from 23.5 to 27.3‰, and the lowest $\delta$11B
              corresponds to the corals close to Last Glacial Maximum. Boron
              concentrations show a variation from 49 to 58 ppm in the recent
              corals, and from 39 to 52 ppm in ancient corals. For the ancient
              corals, linear correlations are observed in both $\delta$11B vs.
              B concentration and $\delta$11B vs. 1/B plots, but these
              correlations are not observed for modern corals. Two
              interpretations are presented to account for these observations
              and to test the potential of $\delta$11B for reconstructing
              paleo-ocean pH. The first interpretation assumes a thermodynamic
              partitioning of B between seawater and carbonates and shows that
              both boron isotopic compositions and concentrations can be used
              to calculate the pH of seawater in which corals grow. For our
              data, such a model requires that both the pH and the $\Sigma$CO2
              of the deglacial ocean was lower than present-day values. The
              second interpretation is based on the correlation observed for
              ancient corals between boron isotopic compositions and 1/B. We
              suggest that the measured boron isotopic compositions of ancient
              corals are caused by the mixing of a primary aragonite (the coral
              skeleton) and secondary aragonite precipitated from 10B-enriched
              reef pore fluids. The characteristics ($\delta$11B and B
              concentrations) of the diagenetic aragonite and the fluids from
              which it precipitates can be constrained. If this proves correct,
              only the non-recrystallised parts of ancient corals can be used
              for paleo-pH reconstructions. These recrystallisation processes

              was found that the boron isotopic compositions of modern marine
              carbonates fall within a relatively narrow range (+22.1 $\pm$
              3\%. relative to NBS SRM951 boric acid standard) for all samples
              (biogenic, nonbiogenic, warm water, cold water, aragonitic, or
              calcitic). This is about 17\%. lighter than seawater. This
              indicates that mineralogy, temperature, and vital effects are not
              primary controls on the observed isotopic composition. The narrow
              range in isotopic composition is in contrast to the wide range in
              boron concentrations of these samples (10.9--71.4 ppm). The boron
              isotopic compositions and boron concentrations in modern marine
              carbonates are consistent with preferential adsorption of the
              isotopically lighter B(OH) 41− aqueous species over the B(OH)3
              species before incorporation into the carbonate site. Because
              there is a pH control on the availability of B(OH)1−4, the result
              is a pH control on the boron abundance in the carbonates.
              Possible second-order biomineralogic controls on pH may account
              for boron concentrations in calcareous organisms that produce low

  abstract  = "Dogwhelks foraging for mussels in an aquarium followed tortuous
               search paths when recently fed and moved faster along straighter
               paths when hungrier. In nature this ``area restricted
               searching'' would tend to keep dogwhelks in areas of high prey
               density and the increased ``directionality'' of movement of
               hungry dogwhelks would tend to take them away from areas of low
               prey density. Dogwhelks encountered different-sized mussels in
               the aquarium in frequencies significantly different from those
               presented, both in terms of numbers and of surface area. Water
               currents may have caused the bias. Dogwhelks inspected
               encountered mussels by crawling over them for $\approx$ 1--2 h.
               A proportion of mussels were rejected after inspection. Relative
               abundances of different-sized accepted mussels were
               significantly different from those of encountered mussels, the
               mean size of mussels in the diet increasing significantly with
               increasing size of the dogwhelks. Size selection became more
               pronounced as dogwhelks, previously fed on barnacles, became
               experienced with mussels. A mussel encountered by an experienced
               dogwhelk was more likely to be attacked if closer to the
               preferred size of 20--25 mm shell length than the previously
               encountered mussel. Accepted mussels were inspected for longer
               than rejected mussels, perhaps as a result of selection of the
               drilling site. Dogwhelks previously fed solely on barnacles
               drilled in random positions on the mussel shell at first, but
               after consuming six to seven mussels they had developed a
               significant tendency to drill in the thinnest area of shells up
               to 25 mm in length and in the area over the digestive gland of
               larger shells. This learned behaviour reduced the drilling time
               for smaller shells by $\approx$ 27\% and, whilst not reducing
               the drilling time for larger shells, it allowed direct access to
               the most profitable organs of the prey. Shells were penetrated
               at a rate of $\approx$ 0.36 mm·day−1. The percentage of mussel
               flesh extracted by adult dogwhelks decreased from $\approx$ 90\%
               for 10-mm to $\approx$ 60\% for 40-mm mussels, the discarded
               flesh being predominantly from the mantle and foot. The
               profitability of mussels, calculated as the ratio of predicted
               weight of flesh extracted to predicted handling time, increased
               monotonically with increasing mussel shell length. The learned
               tendency to drill in the thinnest part of the shell increased
               the profitability of mussels <25 mm by $\approx$ 17\%. Dogwhelks
               engaged in handling mussels were sometimes interrupted or
               displaced by contesting dogwhelks, with a probability that
               increased as handling of the prey progressed. Interlopers
               devalued the prey of occupant dogwhelks by prolonging drilling
               and ingestion, by stealing flesh, or by displacing the occupant.
               The learned tendency of the dogwhelk to drill over the digestive
               gland of larger mussels, allowing quicker access to the most
               profitable tissue, perhaps maximizes the average energy return
               from larger mussels when at risk from interlopers. The
               preference of dogwhelks for mussels smaller than those predicted
               to be the most profitable could reflect the devaluation of
               larger mussels by the risk from interlopers or the increased
               risks of predation, dislodgement or desiccation associated with
               longer handling times for larger mussels.",

              investigations, indicating a constant distribution pattern over a
              long period. The results are discussed in relation to
              eutrophication and the structure of the benthic communities of
              the Wadden Sea. It is concluded that any eutrophication-induced
              increase of the mussel population would be restricted to the
              sheltered parts of the Wadden Sea. Storms will largely determine
              whether the communities of a given area have to compete with
              mussels, which are most important filter feeders of the
              ecosystem. As competition for food is a major factor structuring
              the benthic communities of the Wadden Sea, it is assumed that
              storms indirectly affect all other communities, giving
              deeper-burying, storm-tolerant species a competitive advantage in
              exposed areas where epibenthic mussels are excluded. The impact
              of mussel fisheries will be different for persisting and dynamic
              beds: fishing on persisting beds in sheltered areas may remove
              the crucial reserve which mussel-feeding birds such as eiders or
              oystercatchers need in times of low mussel populations.",

               the known cellular properties of the systems involved. Studies
               on the kinetics of uptake of certain metals in estuarine
               conditions have included the possibility that they can occur in
               non-polar, lipid-soluble forms which may penetrate cell
               membranes very rapidly. It is concluded that the uptake of these

  abstract  = "Due to the high population densities in European countries and
               the fact that pollution prevention measures are either
               non-existent or have only recently begun to be implemented, the
               degree of coastal and freshwater pollution in Europe is quite
               high in certain regions. A number of examples from the marine
               and freshwater field are selected to illustrate specific
               pollution problems and to derive some general conclusions. These
               examples include studies on fish diseases in the North Sea,
               where two species of fish, dab (Limanda limanda) and cod (Gadus
               morhua), are frequently afflicted with externally visible
               diseases. In dab, the disease prevalences amounted to 40\% in
               certain areas. The locations of prevalence ``hot spots'' led to
               the conclusion that pollution might be causing the phenomenon.
               Highest disease prevalences were found in a dumping area for
               wastes from titanium dioxide production, in certain German,
               Danish, and British coastal waters, and on the Dogger Bank (an
               offshore area characterized by high organochlorine and heavy
               metal residues in fish). For coastal waters off Germany and
               Denmark contamination of gonads with PCBs in certain fishes was
               negatively correlated with the viable hatch. Also malformation
               rates were higher in fish embryos from dumping areas and along
               shipping routes than from other stations. PCBs were suspected
               also to be causative factors in the population declines of
               marine mammals in the Baltic between 1900 and 1970. Mercury
               contamination was identified as the paramount pollution problem
               in the Mediterranean where fish for human consumption display
               high contamination levels. Consequences for human consumption
               have not yet been evaluated. Studies on biological effects of
               pollution in the river Rhine were inconclusive despite the fact
               that this river must be considered to be one of the most heavily
               polluted river systems in Europe. Skeletal deformities of
               certain fish occurred in higher prevalences in the polluted
               stretches of the river than in control areas. On the other hand,
               the prevalence of neoplasia in fish livers was not unusually
               high in the polluted river. The example of the river Elbe
               highlights long term degradation of river water quality and its
               impact on biota and illustrates the scientific and public debate
               on the changes. The changes were too slow, and not dramatic
               enough to elicit immediate preventive action. The scientific
               debate on biological changes in the river started in 1798 when
               fishermen complained that their fishery had deteriorated, and
               continues today as scientists struggle to determine whether fish
               populations have decreased or not. From these examples it is
               concluded that scientific evidence for biological changes in
               marine and freshwater ecosystems is frequently debated and does
               not provide the basis needed for sound pollution management
               measures. The ability has to be developed, therefore, to read
               and interpret the signs of environment deterioration and to
               collect circumstantial evidence of ecological malfunctions.

              pollution history and to assess the impact of diagenetic
              processes. The sedimentation rates, based on 210Pb and 137Cs
              inventories, were 0.84--0.90 cm/yr in core E and 1.3--1.7 cm/yr
              in core K. The sediments show a vertical redox zonation with an
              oxic upper layer, where trace metals are mobilized, overlying a
              reduced layer where the metals are precipitated. Though these

              atmospheric CO2, whereas in their preindustrial state they were a
              source; the trophic state of the coastal oceans is progressively
              moving toward increased heterotrophy; and the terrestrial realm
              is now vacillating between trophic states, whereas in
              preindustrial times it was autotrophic. In this paper, we present
              model calculations that underscore the role of human-induced
              perturbations in changing Earth's climate, specifically the role
              of anthropogenic nitrogen and phosphorus in controlling processes
              in the global carbon cycle since the year 1850 with projections
              to the year 2035. Our studies show that since the late 1940's
              emissions of nitrogen and phosphorus have been sequestered in the
              terrestrial living phytomass and groundwater. This
              nutrient-enhanced fertilization of terrestrial biota, coupled
              with rising atmospheric CO2 and global temperature, has induced a
              sink of anthropogenic CO2 that roughly balances the emission of
              CO2 owing to land use change. In the year 2000, for example, the
              model-calculated terrestrial biotic sink was 1730 Mtons C/year,
              while the emission of CO2 from changes in land use was 1820 Mtons
              C/year, a net flux of 90 Mtons C/year emitted to the atmosphere.
              In the global aquatic environment, enhanced terrestrial inputs of
              biotically reactive phosphorus (about 8.5 Mtons P/year) and
              inorganic nitrogen (about 54 Mtons N/year), have induced
              increased new production and burial of organic carbon in marine
              sediments, which is a small sink of anthropogenic CO2. It is
              predicted that the response of the global land reservoirs of C,
              N, and P to sustained anthropogenic perturbations will be
              maintained in the same direction of change over the range of
              projected scenarios of global population increase and temperature
              change for the next 35 years. The magnitude of change is
              significantly larger when the global temperature increase is
              maximum, especially with respect to the processes of
              remobilization of the biotically important nutrients nitrogen and

  abstract  = "The distribution of dissolved Cd, Cu, and Zn in the Scheldt
               estuary has been studied during eight axial surveys, carried out
               between February 1987 and February 1988. The observed
               metal-salinity profiles depend on the season. During spring and
               summer, when the river water is anoxic (containing traces of
               dissolved sulfide), the dissolved metal concentrations in the
               riverine endmember are extremely low. This observation is
               ascribed to formation of sparingly soluble metal sulfides in the
               water column. During winter, when the river water is not totally
               devoid of oxygen (10--40\% saturation), the dissolved Cu and Zn
               concentrations in the riverine endmember are an order of
               magnitude higher, but rapid removal is apparent in the very low
               salinity zone. Flocculation (of organometal complexes) or
               coagulation (of colloid-associated metals), sediment
               resuspension and formation of particulate Fe and Mn
               oxyhydroxides are likely to be involved in the removal process.
               At higher salinities, maxima of dissolved Zn (at 6--9 $\times$
               10−3), Cu (at 9--18 $\times$ 10−3), and Cd (at 12--21 $\times$
               10−3) are consistently found over the year. These maxima are
               ascribed to dissolution and desorption of particulate metal
               forms with increasing salinity. Reoxidation of trace metal
               sulfides during transport from the anoxic (or suboxic) upper
               estuary to the fully oxygenated lower estuary is suggested as
               the first step in the mobilization process. During phytoplankton
               blooms, desorption of Cd and Zn (but not Cu) is suppressed,
               which is attributed to the pH increase related to primary
               production, and to biological uptake. The impact of mobilization
               processes in the Scheldt estuary is reflected by effective
               dissolved Cd and Cu concentrations which are much higher than
               the observed metal concentrations in the river water. Based on
               these findings, it is expected that restoration of the dissolved
               oxygen concentration, which is a major goal of the present-day
               management of the Scheldt estuary, will lead to an increase in
               the dissolved metal transport to the North Sea.",

               calcite single crystals show that boron oxyanions are
               incorporated differentially between nonequivalent vicinal faces
               that compose spiral growth hillocks. The step-selective
               incorporation pattern for boron anions is opposite to that
               observed for the tetrahedral anions SO42− and SeO42−.
               Independent work has shown that a tetrahedrally coordinated
               boron species is preferentially incorporated at the surface
               during growth, yet the boron in the bulk calcite is
               predominantly trigonally coordinated. Hence, there is a change
               in nearest-neighbor coordination of boron at the surface during
               incorporation. A possible explanation for the step-selective
               incorporation of boron lies in a surface-site control over the
               mechanism or rate of this coordination change. The findings
               demonstrate that multiple, structurally distinct surface anion
               sites exist on calcite \{1014\} faces, and inherent differences
               in these sites influence element incorporation and possibly
               surface kinetics. This behavior parallels the known differences
               for incorporation among surface cation sites and further
               confirms that trace and minor element partitioning is strongly
               affected by the structural aspects of mineral surfaces. Such
               site selectivity and associated effects on potential

              and quantum chemistry were applied to the mechanism of this
              synergistic action. The solubility of BCP was markedly increased
              in proportion to elevation of aminopyrine (AM) concentration, but
              not by a combination with isopropylantipyrine (IP). The binding
              of BCP to bovine serum albumin was slightly inhibited by AM, but

              the Bay of Brest was prompted by the decline of the scallop
              fishery in the Bay. Scallops over 30 mm in shell length were
              collected monthly from October 1994 to November 1995. Daily shell
              growth rings were counted using image analysis. Multiple stepwise

              parameters significantly affecting mean daily shell growth rates
              of one- and two-year-old juveniles in 1994 and 1995. Normal
              growth of Pecten shells is mainly regulated by bottom-water
              temperature, salinity and, to a lesser extent, river flow, rather
              than food. In 1995, three major toxic blooms of Gymnodinium cf.
              nagasakiense were recorded, leading to major reductions in shell
              growth rates. The effect of the toxic blooms on the natural
              Pecten populations was all the more important as no wild scallop
              spat settled on artificial collectors during the 1995 summer
              toxic events, and no pre-recruits originating from the 1995
              spawnings were sampled on the bottom, despite good-quality
              spawnings. Two growth retardations were observed for one-year-old
              juveniles during the summer of 1995: the first one appears to be
              related to the sedimentation of a Rhizosolenia
              delicatula--Chaetoceros sociale bloom. It is suggested that the
              large aggregates of these diatoms led to clogging of the scallop
              gills. The second growth decrease was explained by the first
              bloom of G. cf. nagasakiense. The second and third dinoflagellate
              blooms were not associated with daily growth rate decreases in
              one-year-old scallops. The toxic effect of the dinoflagellate
              blooms was greater for two-year-old than for one-year-old
              juveniles; higher filtration rates and/or a differently oriented

               combat Cd toxicity and minimise mortality. Extended starvation
               also caused tissue wastage, leading to higher concentrations of
               Cd and MT in tissues, whereas fed animals increased in weight

              foraminiferal shell as a function of the sea water chemistry and
              the magnitude of vital effects. Concentration profiles of the
              chemical species of the carbonate system within the
              microenvironment of foraminifera are obtained by solving
              diffusion-reaction equations. The compounds of dissolved forms of
              carbon dioxide containing either the stable carbon isotope 13C or
              12C are considered separately. Spherical symmetry of the
              foraminifer is assumed. The model outcome is compared to results
              from culture experiments with the planktonic foraminifer Orbulina
              universa. Model results indicate that the interaction between
              vital effects of the foraminifer and the sea water chemistry can
              account for changes in the $\delta$13C of foraminiferal calcite
              of 0.3--0.4‰ when glacial and interglacial sea water conditions
              are compared. These effects occur even though the $\delta$13C of
              the total dissolved inorganic carbon is kept constant. Thus,
              changes in sea water chemistry should be distinguished from
              events which changed the $\delta$13C of the inorganic carbon of
              the sea water.",

               be an important factor influencing
               calcium-carbonate-precipitation by corals because surface
               seawater is supersaturated with respect to aragonite. Recent
               reports, however, suggest that it could play a major role in the
               evolution and biogeography of recent corals. We investigated the
               calcification rates of five colonies of the zooxanthellate coral
               Stylophora pistillata in synthetic seawater using the alkalinity
               anomaly technique. Changes in aragonite saturation from 98\% to
               585\% were obtained by manipulating the calcium concentration.
               The results show a nonlinear increase in calcification rate as a
               function of aragonite saturation level. Calcification increases
               nearly 3-fold when aragonite saturation increases from 98\% to
               390\%, i.e., close to the typical present saturation state of
               tropical seawater. There is no further increase of calcification
               at saturation values above this threshold. Preliminary data
               suggest that another coral species, Acropora sp., displays a
               similar behaviour. These experimental results suggest: (1) that
               the rate of calcification does not change significantly within
               the range of saturation levels corresponding to the last
               glacial-interglacial cycle, and (2) that it may decrease
               significantly in the future as a result of the decrease in the
               saturation level due to anthropogenic release of CO2 into the
               atmosphere. Experimental studies that control environmental

              demonstrates that Arctica has a widespread distribution in the
              North Sea north of 53°30′N. Along its southern and eastern
              borders the distribution seems to be limited to depths beyond 30
              m. A comparison between distribution patterns of Arctica in
              1972--1994 and in 1996--2000 suggests slight changes along its
              southernmost border in the Oyster Ground. In the south-eastern
              North Sea, the average density of Arctica (>10 mm) was 7
              individuals per 100 m2 and the population was dominated by
              full-grown specimens exceeding 50 mm shell height. The highest
              abundance of spat, juveniles and adults was found in the deeper
              central section of the Oyster Ground that is stratified during
              summer. There, the mean density was 21 individuals (>10 mm) per
              100 m2. These densities were much lower than in the northern
              North Sea (Fladen Ground), where abundance was one to two orders
              of magnitude higher and peaked at 28600 individuals per 100 m2.
              In the Fladen Ground, the population structure was bimodally

              skewed size class distribution suggests that the recruitment to

              reproducing adults generating less dense spatfalls, possibly in
              combination with limited survival of spat and juveniles, prevents
              successful recruitment. Although natural processes may contribute
              to the skewed population structure, intensive bottom trawling is
              thought to have a major effect as well. It is therefore
              questionable whether under present-day conditions the population
              of Arctica in the SE North Sea can be considered sustainable in
              the long term.",

               often seem to co-occur in seawater samples. The concentrations
               of zinc in seawater are anomalously high. A large fraction of
               the zinc entering the oceans of the world is derived from aerial
               deposition. Between 11,000 and 60,000 metric tons of dissolved
               and particulate zinc is deposited from the air into the ocean
               each year. An additional 6,000 tons of dissolved zinc enters the
               oceans each year in river flows. Flux rates of zinc from the
               atmosphere vary widely in different geographic regions. Zinc
               concentrations in estuaries and coastal waters frequently are
               much higher than those in the ocean, with concentrations often

              very complex hierarchical architecture constituted of long
              rod-shaped aragonite crystals stacked parallel to each other
              inside each first order lamella, which are almost perpendicular
              to the ones contained in parallel neighboring lamellae. To better
              understand the construction and properties of the crossed
              lamellar microstructure we have performed a detailed study to
              determine the crystallographic characteristics and their
              evolution during shell growth using scanning electron microscopy,
              transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction texture
              analysis. The arrangement of crystals is rationalized by a set of
              twin law relationships between aragonite crystals. Specifically,
              the aragonite rods, or third order lamellae within each first
              order lamella, internally consist of polysynthetic twins bounded
              by \{110\} mirror planes. In turn, the polysynthetically twinned
              aragonite crystals also show a constant crystallographic
              orientation with respect to aragonite crystals in adjacent first
              order lamellae. It can be seen as another twin law in which
              crystals from adjacent lamellae are bounded by (110) planes but
              with their c-axes rotated within this plane by 30°. Thus there
              are two sets of twin laws that relate crystal units at lower
              (third order lamellae) and higher (first order lamellae) length
              scales. These hierarchical relationships play a crucial role in
              the construction, organization and properties of this complex
              microstructure. The later orientational relationships have never
              been described in geological aragonite and are only found in
              biogenic materials with a crossed lamellar microstructure. Their
              occurrence is probably determined by the presence of shell

               biomonitoring (estimation of environmental quality). Many
               authors, however, have considered these approaches within a
               single context, i.e., as a means of chemical (e.g. metal)
               monitoring. Bivalves are able to accumulate substantial amounts
               of metals from ambient water, but evidence for the drastic
               effects of accumulated metals (e.g. as a TBT-induced shell
               deformation and imposex) on the health of bivalves has not been
               documented. Metal bioaccumulation is a key tool in
               biomonitoring; bioavailability, bioaccumulation, and toxicity of
               various metals in relation to bivalves are described in some
               detail including the development of biodynamic metal
               bioaccumulation model. Measuring metal in the whole-body or the
               tissue of bivalves themselves does not accurately represent true
               contamination levels in the environment; these data are critical
               for our understanding of contaminant trends at sampling sites.

              create three test conditions: ambient and 1°C and 2°C above
              ambient (predicted in the next 50 and 100 years, respectively

               shells that protects their soft tissue from predation and

               mollusk shell alterations as biomarkers of aquatic system
               quality. The studies included herein show that changes to
               natural variables such as salinity, temperature, food

               shells of organisms sampled from multi-impacted areas were found
               to differ in the form and composition of both organic and

              we present results of a spectrophotometric procedure wherein the
              boron isotope equilibrium constant (11--10KB) is determined
              empirically from the difference in the dissociation constants of
              11B(OH)3 and 10B(OH)3 in pure water, 0.6 mol kg−1 H2O KCl and
              artificial seawater. Within experimental uncertainty, our results
              show no dependence of 11--10KB on temperature, but 11--10KB at 25
              °C in pure water was statistically different than results
              obtained in solutions at high ionic strength. 11--10KB of the
              seawater (S=35, BT=0.01 mol kg−1 H2O) at 25 °C is
              1.0272$\pm$0.0006. This result is significantly larger than the
              theoretical value used in numerous paleo-pH studies

               the proxy of oceanic pH provided by the boron isotope ratio of
               foraminiferal carbonate are relatively well understood, but the
               proxy's reliability has been questioned. We present 76 new
               Multi-Collector Inductively-Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry
               (MC-ICPMS) $\delta$11B measurements on a range of benthic
               foraminifera from 23 late-Holocene samples from the Atlantic
               that reaffirm the utility of the $\delta$11B-pH proxy. Our boron
               isotope measurements on ~10 benthic foraminifera tests typically
               yield a precision of ~$\pm$0.25‰ at 2 s.d. (equivalent to
               ~$\pm$0.03 pH units). $\delta$11B values of epifaunal species
               are within analytical uncertainty of those predicted from a
               simple model assuming sole incorporation of B(OH)4− from
               seawater and no vital effects, using the independently
               determined fractionation factor of 1.0272 between 11B/10B of
               aqueous boron species. Infaunal foraminifera are consistent with
               this model, but record the combined effects of lower pore-water
               $\delta$11B and pH. No influence of partial dissolution or shell
               size on $\delta$11B is observed. We have also measured the B/Ca
               ratios of the same samples. For individual Cibicidoides species,
               B/Ca shows a good correlation with $\Delta$[CO32−], but the B/Ca
               of different co-occurring species morphotypes varies
               considerably. These effects are not seen in $\delta$11B, which
               may therefore provide a more robust proxy of the ocean carbonate
               system. Whilst in theory $\delta$11B and B/Ca can be combined to
               provide a quantitative reconstruction of alkalinity and
               dissolved inorganic carbonate (DIC), in practice this is
               precluded by propagated uncertainties. $\delta$11B data give
               significant constraints on foraminifera calcification
               mechanisms, and seem most simply explained by incorporation of
               B(OH)4− into a HCO3− pool, which is then completely incorporated
               in foraminiferal CaCO3. Our demonstration of the predictable
               variation of $\delta$11B with pH, across a wide range of species
               and locations, provides confidence in the application of
               MC-ICPMS measurements of foraminiferal $\delta$11B to

               consistent with the predominant incorporation of the charged

               pH-sensitive ions such as CO32− For a given increase in seawater
               BOH4−, the corresponding increase in B/Ca is stronger when BOH4−
               is raised by increasing [B]SW than when it is raised by
               increasing pH. These results suggest that B incorporation

               $\delta$11BCc of fossil surface-dwelling planktonic foraminifera
               can be used to reconstruct ancient aqueous pCO2 if information
               on a second carbonate system parameter, temperature and salinity
               is available. However, pH and pCO2 of surface waters may vary
               seasonally, largely due to changes in temperature, DIC, and
               alkalinity. As also the shell fluxes of planktonic foraminifera
               show species-specific seasonal patterns that are linked to
               intra-annual changes in temperature, it is obvious that
               $\delta$11BCc of a certain species reflects the pH and thus pCO2
               biased towards a specific time period within a year. This is
               important to consider for the interpretation of fossil
               $\delta$11BCc records that may mirror seasonal pH signals. Here
               we present new Multi-Collector Inductively Coupled Mass

               the inferred season-adjusted $\delta$11BCc/$\delta$11Bborate
               relationships are similar to existing calibrations and can be
               combined with published $\delta$11BCc field and culture data to
               augment paleo-pH calibrations. To test the applicability of
               these calibrations, we used a core drilled on the Walvis Ridge
               in the Southeast Atlantic spanning the last 330,000 years to
               reconstruct changes in surface-water pCO2. The reconstruction
               based on G. bulloides, which reflects the austral spring season,
               was shown to yield values that closely resemble the Vostok
               ice-core data indicating that surface-water pCO2 was close to
               equilibrium with the atmosphere during the cooler spring season.
               In contrast, pCO2 estimated from $\delta$11BCc of O. universa,
               T. sacculifer and G. ruber that predominantly lived during the
               warmer seasons, exhibits up to ∼50 ppmv higher values than the
               Vostok ice-core data. This is probably due to the higher austral
               summer and fall temperatures, as shown by Mg/Ca to be on average
               ∼4 °C higher than during the cooler spring season, accounting
               for an increase in pCO2 of ∼4\% per 1 °C. Our results

              Globigerina bulloides, in laboratory culture experiments. Our
              results demonstrate that at constant temperature, U/Ca in O.
              universa decreases by 25 $\pm$ 7\% per 100 $\mu$mol [CO32−] kg−1,
              as seawater [CO32−] increases from 110 to 470 $\mu$mol kg−1.
              Results from G. bulloides suggest a similar relationship, but
              U/Ca is consistently offset by ∼+40\% at the same environmental
              [CO32−]. In O. universa, U/Ca is insensitive to temperature
              between 15°C and 25°C. Applying the O. universa relationship to
              three U/Ca records from a related species, Globigerinoides
              sacculifer, we estimate that Caribbean and tropical Atlantic
              [CO32−] was 110 $\pm$ 70 $\mu$mol kg−1 and 80 $\pm$ 40 $\mu$mol
              kg−1 higher, respectively, during the last glacial period
              relative to the Holocene. This result is consistent with
              estimates of the glacial--interglacial change in surface water
              [CO32−] based on both modeling and on boron isotope pH estimates.
              In settings where the addition of U by diagenetic processes is
              not a factor, down-core records of foraminiferal U/Ca have
              potential to provide information about changes in the ocean's
              carbonate concentration. Below ambient pH (pH < 8.2), Mg/Ca
              decreased by 7 $\pm$ 5\% (O. universa) to 16 $\pm$ 6\% (G.
              bulloides) per 0.1 unit increase in pH. Above ambient pH, the
              change in Mg/Ca was not significant for either species. This
              result suggests that Mg/Ca-based paleotemperature estimates for
              the Quaternary, during which surface-ocean pH has been at or
              above modern levels, have not been biased by variations in
              surface-water pH. Sr/Ca increased linearly by 1.6 $\pm$ 0.4\% per
              0.1 unit increase in pH. Shell Mg/Ca increased exponentially with
              temperature in O. universa, where Mg/Ca = 0.85 exp (0.096*T),

               the amplitude of ``vital effects'' on this proxy that are not

               temperature (24$\pm$0.1°C) in seawater with pH ranging between
               7.90 and 8.45. Intra-shell boron isotopes showed large
               variability with an upper limit value of $\approx$30‰. Our
               results suggest that the fractionation factor $\alpha$4-3 of
               0.97352 (Klochko et al., 2006) is in better agreement with our
               experiments and with direct pH measurements in seawater vacuoles

               foraminifera. Despite the large variability of the skeletal pH

               lowest calculated pH values to the experimental culture pH
               values while the upper pH limit is slightly below 9. This
               variability can be interpreted as follows: foraminifera variably
               increase the pH at the biomineralization site to about 9. This
               increase above ambient seawater pH leads to a range in
               $\delta$11B ($\Delta$11B) for each seawater pH. This $\Delta$11B
               is linearly correlated with the culture seawater pH with a slope
               of −13.1 per pH unit, and is independent of the fractionation
               factor $\alpha$4-3, or the $\delta$11Bsw through time. It may
               also be independent of the pKB (the dissociation constant of
               boric acid) value. Therefore, $\Delta$11B in foraminifera can

              every 12h between ambient seawater ($\delta$18Ow=−0.4‰ VSMOW) and
              seawater with enriched barium and $\delta$18Ow=+18.6‰ VSMOW, to
              produce geochemically distinct layers of calcite, separated by
              calcite precipitated with an ambient geochemical signature. We
              quantify the position of the Ba-labeled calcite in the shell wall
              of O. universa via laser ablation ICP-MS depth profiling of trace
              element ratios, and then measure intrashell $\delta$18Ocalcite in
              the same shells using SIMS with a 3$\mu$m spot and an average
              precision of 0.6‰ ($\pm$2 SD). Measured $\delta$18Ocalcite values
              in O. universa shell layers are within $\pm$1.1‰ of predicted
              $\delta$18Ocalcite values. Elemental and oxygen isotope data show
              that LA-ICP-MS and SIMS measurements can be cross-correlated
              within the spatial resolution of the two analytical techniques,
              and that $\delta$18Ocalcite and elemental tracers appear to be
              precipitated synchronously with no measurable spatial offsets.
              These results demonstrate the capability of SIMS to resolve daily

               Blanchard, Marc and Schott, Jacques and Gaillardet, J{\'e}rome",
  abstract  = "Despite the importance of boron as a proxy of past ocean pH, the
               crystal-chemical factors controlling its incorporation in the
               structure of calcium carbonates are still poorly understood.
               This is partly linked to an imperfect knowledge of the
               coordination, protonation state and local environment of boron
               species in these minerals. In the present study, we use
               first-principles quantum mechanical tools to model selected
               trigonal and tetragonal boron species in calcite and aragonite.
               The stable geometry of the models is obtained from standard
               energy minimization schemes or using a more advanced
               metadynamics exploration of their configurational space. The
               computation of 11B NMR chemical shifts and quadrupolar coupling
               parameters enables a straightforward comparison of the models to
               existing experimental NMR data. The results show that B in
               calcium carbonates does occur as structural species substituted
               for CO32− anions. The B speciation depends on the polymorph
               considered. In calcite, structural boron is present as partially
               deprotonated trigonal BO2(OH)2− species coexisting with a
               fraction of substituted B(OH)4− groups. In aragonite, the
               B(OH)4− substitution for CO32− anions is dominant. Different
               species, including entrapped B(OH)3 molecules and substituted
               BO33− groups also occur in biogenic samples. The diversity of B
               speciation reflects a diversity of B incorporation mechanisms
               and sheds light on previous studies confronting B isotopic
               composition determination with NMR observations. The mechanisms
               of boron incorporation in calcium carbonates are probably more
               complex than usually assumed in the literature using boron
               isotopes as a proxy of paleo-atmospheric CO2 reconstructions.
               Although not invalidating the empirical paleo-pH proxy, these
               results call for a better understanding of the fundamental
               mechanisms of boron incorporation in carbonates.",

               the fundamental reactions that govern the incorporation and
               subsequent isotope fractionation of this element in these
               materials. Toward this goal we have investigated boron
               adsorption on the surface of amorphous silica (SiO2·0.32H2O) and
               quantified its isotopic fractionation. Boron adsorption
               envelopes and corresponding isotope fractionation factors were
               measured in dilute aqueous solutions (0.01 M) of NaCl and CaCl2.
               B maximum adsorbed fraction was found to be about 2 times higher
               in CaCl2 solutions than in NaCl. The modelling of chemical and
               isotopic data in NaCl solutions allowed to identify the
               formation of two main B surface species at the SiO2(am)/water
               interface: a neutral trigonal (B3) inner-sphere complex,
               >SiOB(OH)20, characterized by a fractionation factor of ∼ -16 ‰
               relative to aqueous boric acid, and a negatively charged
               tetrahedral (B4) inner-sphere complex, >SiOB(OH)3--, with
               fractionation factors of -5 ‰ with respect to aqueous borate. In
               CaCl2 solutions the data modelling indicates the presence of B4
               inner-sphere complexes with a fractionation factor of -6.5 ‰
               relative to aqueous borate, but excludes the presence of
               trigonal surface species and suggests instead the formation of a
               Ca-B(OH)4-- complex that could partly account for the observed
               increase of boron adsorption in these solutions. These
               observations indicate that changes in the surface charge density
               and interfacial water structure due to different background
               electrolytes can induce changes in concentration and both
               chemical and isotopic composition of B adsorbed on silica
               surfaces. Although this study suggests that the B adsorption
               reaction on SiO2(am) plays a minor role in the B incorporation
               and isotopic signature of clay minerals and siliceous cements
               forming during weathering reactions, the acquired data should
               allow for an improved knowledge of the biomineralization
               reactions. The observed B isotopic fractionations between
               adsorbed and aqueous B species should help determining the
               relative contribution of various processes, such as cellular
               transport, biological mediation and silicification reactions, on
               the amount of B incorporated in siliceous microorganisms and its
               isotopic signatures. In addition, the presence in NaCl solutions
               of both trigonal and tetrahedral boron complexes at the silica
               surface could explain the observed weak pH dependence of the

  abstract = "Metals are common contaminants worldwide. Long-term deposition of
              metals in soils can lead to accumulation, transport and
              biotoxicity/zootoxicity caused by mobility and bioavailability of
              significant fraction of the metals. Contaminant bioavailability
              is increasingly being used as a key indicator of potential risk
              that contaminants pose to both environmental and human health.
              However, the definition of bioavailability and the concepts on
              which it is based are still unclear, the methods adopted for its
              measurement vary and as such there is no single standard
              technique for the assessment of either plant availability of
              contaminants or their ecotoxicological impacts on soil biota.
              Moreover, bioavailability is often assumed to be static in nature
              where most decisions on risk and remediation are based on
              laboratory estimations of the bioavailable fraction, which may
              vary with time, nature of species as well as with temporal
              variation in environmental factors. Because of their immutable
              nature, strict natural attenuation processes alone may not be
              sufficient in mitigating the risks from metals. However,
              accelerating these processes with human interference (i.e.,
              assisted natural remediation) that effectively immobilizes metals
              might be a viable option. Application to soils of certain
              amendments that enhance key biogeochemical processes in soils
              that effectively immobilize metals have already been demonstrated
              in Europe and North America on a field scale. Case studies using
              lime, phosphate and biosolid amendments have demonstrated, under
              field conditions, enhanced natural remediation resulting in
              substantially improved vegetation growth, invigorated microbial
              population and diversity, and reduced offsite metal transport.
              Depending on soil/hydrogeochemical properties, source term and
              metal form/species, and land use, the immobilization efficacy
              induced by such assisted natural remediation may be enduring. The
              use of green plants as a remediation tool in environmental
              cleanup has also offered some potential. Plants can uptake and
              bioaccumulate (phytoextraction) as well as immobilize
              (phytoimmobilization) certain trace elements, in conjunction with
              their rhizospheric processes. While long-term stability of
              certain metal complexes, such as metal pyromorphites has been
              shown in model systems, the influence of plant roots and its
              microbial and mycorrhizal association on such stability is
              unknown. A suite of chemical and biological tests are available
              to monitor the efficacy of assisted natural remediation.",

              their environment, making them useful indicators of climate,
              pollution, and ecosystem changes. However, biological factors can
              also influence chemical properties of biogenic carbonate.
              Understanding how these factors affect chemical incorporation is
              essential for studies that use elemental chemistry of carbonates
              as indicators of environmental parameters. This study examined
              the effects of bivalve shell growth rate and age on the
              incorporation of elements into juvenile softshell clams, Mya
              arenaria. Although previous studies have explored the effects of
              these two biological factors, reports have differed depending on
              species and environmental conditions. In addition, none of the
              previous studies have examined growth rate and age in the same
              species and within the same study. We reared clams in controlled
              laboratory conditions and used solution-based inductively coupled
              plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis to explore whether
              growth rate affects elemental incorporation into shell. Growth
              rate was negatively correlated with Mg, Mn, and Ba shell
              concentration, possibly due to increased discrimination ability
              with size. The relationship between growth rate and Pb and Sr was
              unresolved. To determine age effects on incorporation, we used
              laser ablation ICP-MS to measure changes in chemical composition
              across shells of individual clams. Age affected incorporation of
              Mn, Sr, and Ba within the juvenile shell, primarily due to
              significantly different elemental composition of early shell
              material compared to shell accreted later in life. Variability in
              shell composition increased closer to the umbo (hinge), which may
              be the result of methodology or may indicate an increased ability
              with age to discriminate against ions that are not calcium or
              carbonate. The effects of age and growth rate on elemental
              incorporation have the potential to bias data interpretation and

              an indicator of thermal capacity of the Antarctic limpet (Nacella
              concinna) to cope with regional warming is the ability to right
              if removed from the substratum and turned upside down. As part of
              an on-going study into limpet genetics and phenotypic plasticity,
              we tested the temperature limits for 50\% righting of limpets
              from 6 and 30m depth. The 50\% threshold for limpets collected
              from 6m (4.7°C) was higher than for those collected from 30m
              (0.7°C). This compares with a previously published limit of 2.2°C
              for limpets collected from 12--15m at the same location. These

              greater angle to right than tall limpets. Of the factors that
              cause morphological plasticity of gastropod shells, iceberg
              disturbance is the most likely cause of the sub-tidal gradient in
              N. concinna shell shape, and therefore the thermal limit for

              repair shell in L. uva were tested with four treatments; a low

              include either a flight response, to escape the most extreme

              itself are presented, discussed and compared to comparable
              long-term studies. For most of those pollutants atmospheric and
              aquatic emission data are available from 1985 onward. Earliest
              studies about pollutants in the Scheldt Estuary go back to 1978
              and the general trend observed for their concentrations in the
              estuary agrees fairly well with the evolution of their emissions.
              Until the end of the nineties trace metal concentrations
              decreased at the fluvial and marine end-members of the estuary.
              However, recent surveys indicate that the dissolved trace metal
              concentrations particularly in the estuary increased again, while
              their emissions did not. No historical data about PCDD/Fs'
              concentrations in the Scheldt River Basin and the Belgian Coastal
              Zone are available. However, the time trend of the PCDD/F

              emission reductions. The particulate trace metal concentrations
              in the Belgian Coastal Zone and in the mouth of the Scheldt
              Estuary follow the same trend. Nevertheless, Scheldt estuarine
              inputs to the Greater North Sea decrease slower than those of
              other estuaries. In sediments of the Upper Scheldt River, a clear
              decrease for Cd, Pb and Zn, but not for Cu was observed between
              1980 and 2007. Also PAH concentrations in those sediments are not
              decreasing during the last 10years. A time lag exists between the
              moment that a reduction in the emission of a given pollutant is
              realized and the decrease of its concentration in the receiving

              funebralis may be more prone to dissolution because their outer

              potentially increasing the surface area on which dissolution can
              occur. These results support a previous study where T. funebralis

              of potential response is needed. There is a need for the
              identification of rare, key or unique genomes and physiologies
              that should be made priorities for conservation because of their
              importance to global biodiversity. The new discipline of
              conservation physiology is one aspect of the many ways in which
              organismal responses to environmental variability and change can
              be investigated, but wider approaches are needed. Environmental
              change, whether natural or human induced occurs over a very wide
              range of scales, from nanometres to global and seconds to
              millennia. The processes involved in responses also function over
              a wide range of scales, from the molecular to the ecosystem.
              Organismal responses to change should be viewed in these wider
              frameworks. Within this overall framework the rate of change of
              an environmental variable dictates which biological process will
              be most important in the success or failure of the response.
              Taking this approach allows an equation to be formulated that
              allows the likely survival of future change to be estimated:where
              Ps=Probability of survival; PF=Physiological flexibility; GM=Gene
              pool modification rate; NP=number in population; F=Fitness;

               homogeneous oceanographic and climatic characteristics over
               their geographic and stratigraphic ranges. The discovery of
               numerous genetically-defined cryptic species challenges the
               morphospecies concept in planktonic foraminifera and
               paleoceanographic interpretations based on them. Here, we
               present a combined genetic and biometric analysis of Orbulina
               universa specimens in the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans.
               Our study is based on shells retained after DNA extractions. On
               those genotyped shells, we perform biometric analyses (shell
               size and thickness, inner porosity and pore surface
               distribution). Our genetic data confirm the presence of three
               cryptic species of O. universa in the world ocean, whose
               distributions are primarily correlated to the productivity of
               the surface waters. The Mediterranean species of O. universa is
               most abundant in the vertically mixed and nutrient-rich areas of
               the low to mid-latitudes, whereas the Caribbean and Sargasso
               species occur in stratified and oligotrophic subtropical waters.
               Our biometric data show no correlation between shell size and
               inner porosity within each cryptic species of O. universa.
               Combining Principal Component Analyses with MANOVAs performed on
               shell pore surface distribution, we demonstrate that the three
               different cryptic species are characterized by significant
               morphological differentiation. The Caribbean species typically
               exhibits large pores and higher porosity values, while the
               Mediterranean and Sargasso species are characterized by smaller
               pore areas and shell porosity. A model based upon pore surface
               distribution correctly assigns 60\% to 90\% of the specimens to
               their corresponding genotype. Although the inner shell surface
               of the Sargasso species resembles that of the Mediterranean
               species, our model demonstrates that the pore surface
               distributions of these two cryptic species can be distinguished.
               Finally, the Sargasso species exhibits significantly thinner
               shells than the two other cryptic species.",

               used to differentiate two morphotypes present in sediment trap
               samples collected from the Cariaco Basin, Venezuela.
               Specifically, wall thickness and weight--area relationships were
               used to separate shells into thin (Mthin) and thick (Mthick)
               morphotypes. Mthick (mean thickness=19--41$\mu$m) comprises 75\%
               of the total O. universa in these samples and has morphometric
               characteristics similar to that of the previously described Type
               I Caribbean genotype, whereas Mthin (mean thickness=6--22$\mu$m)
               is comparable to the Type III Mediterranean genotype. The flux
               of Mthick increases during periods of upwelling, whereas Mthin
               flux shows no systematic relationship with changing hydrographic
               regimes in the basin. The $\delta$18O and $\delta$13C of Mthick
               are on average 0.34‰ higher and 0.38‰ lower, respectively, than
               those of Mthin, suggesting that they calcify their final
               spherical chamber at different depths in the water column and/or
               differ in their vital effects on shell geochemistry.
               Additionally, the absolute offset in the stable isotopic
               compositions of the two morphotypes varies as a function of
               surface ocean stratification. During periods of upwelling, the
               $\delta$18O and $\delta$13C absolute offsets between Mthin and
               Mthick are on average −0.15 and 0.25‰, whereas average
               $\delta$18O and $\delta$13C absolute offsets between these two
               morphotypes increase to −0.54 and 0.41‰ during non-upwelling
               periods. We attribute the higher $\delta$18O and $\delta$13C
               offsets during non-upwelling periods to a difference in final
               chamber calcification depth and the combined effects of
               temperature ($\delta$18O), $\delta$13CDIC ($\delta$13C),
               irradiance ($\delta$13C) and [CO32−] ($\delta$18O and
               $\delta$13C). These data provide field evidence that thin and
               thick morphotypes of O. universa likely experience different
               environmental conditions during the formation of their final
               chamber and, therefore, should not be combined in geochemical
               analyses for reconstructing past surface ocean conditions.
               Finally, we introduce a new proxy for reconstructing past
               surface ocean stratification changes via the use of Mthin and

              ocean. Despite this importance, the main functions of
              foraminifera's test and ornamentation such as spines are unclear.
              Spinose species dominate the planktonic foraminifera population
              in subtropical oligotrophic gyres, while non-spinose species
              dominate in deeper waters and at high latitudes suggesting that

              novel approach to investigate the benefits of spines on
              foraminifera foraging using a 0-D trait-based ecosystem model.
              The model considers the traits of size, calcification, spines,
              passive feeding, and diet. We assess how the presence of spines
              impact foraminifera diet and fitness via a series of simulated
              environments representing oligo, meso- and eutrophic settings at
              different temperatures. We find that independent of diet,
              non-spinose taxa need to be more size-generalist predators than
              other zooplankton species to maintain their population. In
              contrast, spinose species benefit from a relatively higher
              surface-to-volume ratio compared to non-spinose species, which
              allows them to be as generalist as other zooplankton groups. In
              agreement with observations, we find that herbivory is the most
              successful diet in cold environments, while carnivory allows

              of lead pollution. Previous studies have stressed that shells
              display little variability compared to soft tissues and thus are
              better for pollution biomonitoring. However, in this manuscript
              we illustrate that there is large inter- and intra-annual Pb
              variability between shells of the clam Mercenaria mercenaria
              collected in North Carolina, USA. Therefore, year to year, as
              well as intra-annual variations in Pb/Ca ratios should be
              interpreted with caution. Despite this variability, we were able
              to obtain an annual Pb chronology from 1949 to 2002 using 11
              shells collected at different times which clearly exhibited the
              late 1970's peak in Pb from leaded gasoline use. This indicates
              that when enough specimens are pooled together, bivalve shells
              can be used to reconstruct large, long term changes in
              environmental Pb concentrations. Our data compare well with other
              studies of aragonite clams from sites with low regional lead
              pollution. From this we conclude that the Cape Lookout region of
              North Carolina has not received extensive pollution over the
              1949-2002 period. The Pb concentration in shells growing in the
              1949-1976 period was not significantly different from those
              growing in the 1982-2002 period, although other proxies suggest
              that the 1949-1976 period should be considerably higher.
              Therefore, our data suggest that there is still a modern

              Arctica islandica. The iron content in pre-industrial shells from
              the North Sea largely remained below the detection limit. Only
              since 1830, shell Fe levels rose gradually reflecting the
              combined effect of increased terrestrial runoff of iron-bearing
              sediments and eutrophication. Although the lead gasoline peak of
              the 20th century was well recorded by the shells, bivalves that
              lived during the medieval heyday of metallurgy showed four-fold
              higher shell Pb levels than modern specimens. Presumably,
              pre-industrial bivalves were offered larger proportions of
              resuspended (Pb-enriched) organics, whereas modern specimens
              receive fresh increased amounts of (Pb-depleted) phytoplankton.
              As expected, metal loads in the shells from Iceland were much
              lower. Our study confirms that bivalve shells provide a powerful

              suitable for a high-resolution, free-surface, terrain-following
              coordinate oceanic model. Due to mathematical feedback between
              the baroclinic momentum and tracer equations and, similarly,
              between the barotropic momentum and continuity equations, it is
              advantageous to treat both modes so that, after a time step for
              the momentum equation, the computed velocities participate
              immediately in the computation of tracers and continuity, and
              vice versa, rather than advancing all equations for one time step
              simultaneously. This leads to a new family of time-stepping
              algorithms that combine forward--backward feedback with the best
              known synchronous algorithms, allowing an increased time step due

              addresses multiple numerical issues associated with mode
              splitting. This kernel utilizes consistent temporal averaging of
              the barotropic mode via a specially designed filter function to
              guarantee both exact conservation and constancy preservation
              properties for tracers and yields more accurate (up to
              second-order), resolved barotropic processes, while preventing
              aliasing of unresolved barotropic signals into the slow
              baroclinic motions. It has a more accurate mode-splitting due to
              redefined barotropic pressure-gradient terms to account for the
              local variations in density field, while maintaining the
              computational efficiency of a split model. It is naturally
              compatible with a variety of centered and upstream-biased
              high-order advection algorithms, and helps to mitigate

               How marine organisms adjust or succumb to such environmental
               changes may be determined by their ability to balance energy
               intake against expenditure (i.e. energy budget) as energy

               value. Here, we examined whether energy budget is a driver of
               physiological adaptability of marine calcifiers to the
               near-future ocean acidification and warming; i.e. how
               physiological energetics (respiration rate, feeding rate, energy

               growth and shell properties of a calcifying gastropod

               the energy budget of gastropods due to increased feeding rate,
               resulting in faster shell growth and greater shell strength
               (i.e. more mechanically resilient). When combined with ocean
               acidification, however, the gastropods had a substantial
               decrease in energy budget due to reduced feeding rate and energy
               assimilation, leading to the reduction in shell growth and shell
               strength. By linking energy budget to the adjustability of shell
               building, we revealed that energy availability can be critical

               high levels of metals due to dumping and disturbance of
               contaminated material. We established that increased levels of
               metal pollution (zinc, copper and lead) in sediments near the
               Isle of Man, resulting from historical mining, strongly
               correlated with significant weakening of shell strength in king
               scallops, Pecten maximus. This weakness increased mortality
               during fishing and left individuals more exposed to predation.
               Comparative structural analysis revealed that shells from the

               mineralisation disruption parallel to the shell surface within

              before in this area, labile trace metals were measured using the
              passive sampling technique of Diffusive Gradients in Thin-films
              (DGT), while total dissolved and particulate trace metal
              concentrations were assessed using classic active sampling
              techniques. This dual approach allowed us to highlight the
              variations of trace metal speciation and distribution in the
              estuarine surface waters, considering environmental and
              physicochemical gradients along the transect. The large data set
              obtained was then compared with literature data of historical
              measurements along the Scheldt (from 1980 until now), but also
              from other estuaries. As emphasized by our results, trace metal
              mobility and partitioning along the Scheldt estuary was mainly
              driven by biogeochemical reactions which were strongly influenced
              by gradients of specific estuarine physico-chemical parameters,
              such as salinity, turbidity, temperature and so on. Hence, all
              species of trace metals displayed a non-conservative behavior.
              More precisely, dissolved labile fractions of trace metals showed
              higher levels in the middle estuary, where many solubilization
              and remobilization processes occurred due to turbulent mixing
              mechanisms and an increasing salinity. Our study confirmed the
              decreasing trend historically observed for particulate metals
              along the Scheldt, as well as the rising concentrations recorded
              for dissolved trace metals which might also lead to an increase
              of their labile fraction measured by the DGT. Finally, these
              preliminary results suggested that a more regular monitoring of
              labile metal along the Scheldt estuary is essential to have an
              in-depth understanding of trace metal speciation and to review
              bioavailability of trace metals within estuarine ecosystems.",

               Spatial gradients of Pb, Cd, and Zn contamination were
               identified along S{\o}rfjord, and metal concentrations were
               consistently higher (1.7--8.3 times) in the body compartments of
               large asteroids sampled close to the smelters than in those
               sampled further away. Cd and Pb concentrations in the pyloric
               caeca varied along the fjord according to a decreasing sigmoidal
               relationship, while Cd and Pb concentrations in the body wall
               and the skeleton varied according to a decreasing exponential
               relationship. This suggests that the bioavailability of these
               metals has decreased over the last few years at the head of the
               fjord, which agrees generally with water chemistry data
               available from the State Pollution Monitoring Programme
               (Norway). The decrease in metal bioavailability could be a
               direct consequence of the 1992 remedial action taken in the
               fjord to reduce heavy metal release from the contaminated
               sediments. Lead concentrations in the skeletons of large
               asteroids (12--14cm; 154 $\pm$ 63 $\mu$g Pb g−1 dry wt) were
               eight times higher than those in the skeletons of juvenile
               individuals (0.5--4 cm; 19 $\pm$ 8 $\mu$g Pb g−1 dry wt) in the
               population located at the head of the fjord. Asteroids of 12--14
               cm length were likely to be 4--7 y old (i.e. born before the
               remedial action) while small asteroids were born after the
               remedial action. According to comparisons with allometric
               relationships in an uncontaminated population and experimental
               exposures, results indicate that the half-life of Pb in the
               skeleton is long (i.e. several years) while the half-life of Cd
               and Zn is much shorter (i.e. several weeks for Cd, and short but
               not precisely known for Zn). A smaller size and unusual
               reduction of the skeleton of adult individuals at the head of
               the fjord were observed and may result from the effects of heavy
               metal pollution. A comparison between possible sources of
               contamination in the fjord (metals in water, food, and
               sediments) indicates that sediment-associated metals are likely
               to be an important source of contamination in this environment

               activity on the boron isotopic composition of shell calcite.
               Under low light (reduced photosynthetic rates) the boron
               isotopic composition of the tests is 1.5‰ lower compared to

               In terms of inferred pH, the lower boron isotope values
               correspond to a reduction in pH of approximately 0.2 units. The
               boron isotopic composition of Orbulina universa from plankton
               tows is similar to that of shells grown under low light

               the mainland coast of central southern England as TBT use has
               been progressively restricted, and to quantify the extent of
               imposex impact on the populations present. We surveyed from
               Poole to Selsey where isolated populations had become extinct,
               and the Isle of Wight where some populations had persisted. We
               found evidence that since TBT restrictions, recolonization and
               colonization by N. lapillus has been rapid. By 2007--2008, of
               the eleven surveyed mainland sites, seven were colonized,
               although indications of reduced imposex impacts were mixed.
               Distribution had also extended on the Isle of Wight and
               populations were larger with less imposex impact in sites with
               long term populations. The lack of continuous suitable habitat
               blocks and the hydrodynamic complexity of the region, leads us
               to hypothesize that recovery has been facilitated by man-made
               structures which may be acting as `stepping stones'. Populations
               that have become established on engineered structures such as
               sea walls, breakwaters and rock groynes demonstrate accelerated
               recovery in the region as TBT in the environment has generally
               declined. Sites with suitable substrates and food sources near
               to ports were either not recolonized or had small populations
               with imposex evident. For species with a short pelagic larval
               stage or with direct development, population connectivity
               between patches of harder substrata along hydrodynamically
               complex coastlines may be greater than previously thought.",

               purely inorganic systems that were found to stabilize aragonite

               was used to characterize the nucleation behavior of the system,

               and high-resolution powder X-ray diffraction show that pristine
               spines and test plates are composed of Mg-rich calcite and
               comprise about 1.2 to 1.6 wt \% organics, 10 wt \% of anhydrous

              the future impacts of ocean acidification (OA), but recent
              evidence suggests that they may be able to maintain calcification
              and overall fitness. The underlying mechanism remains unclear but
              may be attributed to mineralogical plasticity, which modifies the
              energetic cost of calcification. To test the hypothesis that
              mineralogical plasticity enables the maintenance of shell growth
              and functionality under OA conditions, we assessed the biological
              performance of a gastropod (respiration rate, feeding rate,
              somatic growth, and shell growth of Austrocochlea constricta) and
              analyzed its shell mechanical and geochemical properties (shell
              hardness, elastic modulus, amorphous calcium carbonate, calcite
              to aragonite ratio, and magnesium to calcium ratio). Despite
              minor metabolic depression and no increase in feeding rate, shell
              growth was faster under OA conditions, probably due to increased
              precipitation of calcite and trade-offs against inner shell
              density. In addition, the resulting shell was functionally
              suitable for increasingly ``corrosive'' oceans, i.e., harder and

              performance of calcifying organisms under OA conditions and could

              adaptation can be achieved. Marine calcifiers are particularly
              vulnerable to ocean acidification due to dissolution and a
              reduction in shell-building carbonate ions. Long-term experiments
              assess organisms' abilities to acclimatize or even adapt to
              environmental change. Here we present an unexpected compensatory
              response to extensive shell dissolution in a highly
              calcium-carbonate-dependent organism after long-term culture in
              predicted end-century acidification and warming conditions.
              Substantial shell dissolution with decreasing pH posed a threat
              to both a polar ( Liothyrella uva) and a temperate ( Calloria
              inconspicua) brachiopod after 7 months and 3 months exposure,
              respectively, with more extensive dissolution in the polar
              species. This impact was reflected in decreased outer primary
              layer thickness in the polar brachiopod. A compensatory response
              of increasing inner secondary layer thickness, and thereby
              producing a thicker shell, was exhibited by the polar species.
              Less extensive dissolution in the temperate brachiopod did not
              affect shell thickness. Increased temperature did not impact
              shell dissolution or thickness. Brachiopod ability to produce a

               composed of radially distributed elongated crystals, whereas the
               blocklike structure involves crystalline aggregates with
               irregular shape. The individual aggregates are approximately
               single crystal, with orientations identical to that of the

               from spherulitic to nacreous microstructures shows more

              mussel Perna viridis with or without laboratory preexposure to Cd
              or Zn. Efflux rate constants and clearance rates were little
              affected by preexposure to either Cd or Zn. In contrast, the
              assimilation of Cd increased by 1.2-1.6 in mussels preexposed to
              Cd (subsequent Cd concentrations 10.2-25.9 microg(-1)) as
              compared to controls (0.19-0.39 microg g(-1)). This increase
              corresponded to an elevation in the proportion of Cd associated
              with the metallothionein-like proteins (MTLPs) in the mussels,
              suggesting that exposure to Cd and subsequent induction of MTLPs
              affected Cd accumulation. Exposure to Zn only resulted in
              elevated body concentrations following 7-d exposure to 250 microg
              L(-1), although Zn and Cd uptake from the dissolved phase were
              reduced by 24-47\% by exposure to a lower concentration (100
              microg L(-1)) for 7 and 21 d. Despite the lack of an increase in
              body Zn concentration, the subcellular distribution was altered
              such that the proportion of Zn associated with the metal-rich
              granules increased. This study indicates the importance of the
              subcellular distribution of metals in affecting the biokinetics
              and thus the toxic effects of metals on aquatic animals. Cd
              preexposure has potential effects on its influx from the dietary
              phase, e.g., increasing the importance of dietary uptake and
              further increasing the body burdens. In contrast, preexposure to
              Zn has a negative effect on Cd and Zn influx from the dissolved
              phase, suggesting the mechanism of Zn regulation but also
              potentially reducing Cd uptake and body concentrations over the
              long-term exposure. Such effects may have implications for
              biomonitoring studies involving a single species that modifies
              physiological processes affecting metal uptake (and hence
              bioavailability). Caution is needed in extrapolating data to
              species not capable of making such changes, particularly for Cd,
              which is not regulated and for which the effects of an elevated

              remarkable strength and toughness, but the mechanisms leading to
              its formation are not well understood. Here we present
              synchrotron spectromicroscopy experiments revealing that stacks
              of aragonite tablet crystals in nacre are misoriented with
              respect to each other. Quantitative measurements of crystal

              orientational ordering occurs not abruptly but gradually over a
              distance of 50 microm. Several lines of evidence indicate that
              different crystal orientations imply different tablet growth

               the pH of the foraminiferal microenvironment. We therefore
               suggest smaller individuals must live at approximately 50?100 m

               In contrast to previous interpretations we suggest that these

               compositionally distinct gametogenic calcite in small
               individuals compared to larger ones. As with $\delta$11B this

               relative to their surface area, particularly in the world's
               major eastern boundary upwelling systems. Along oceanic eastern
               boundaries, equatorward wind stress and the Earth's rotation
               combine to drive a near-surface layer of water offshore, a
               process called Ekman transport. Similarly, positive wind stress
               curl drives divergence in the surface Ekman layer and
               consequently upwelling from below, a process known as Ekman
               suction. In both cases, displaced water is replaced by upwelling
               of relatively nutrient-rich water from below, which stimulates
               the growth of microscopic phytoplankton that form the base of
               the marine food web. Ekman theory is foundational and underlies
               the calculation of upwelling indices such as the ?Bakun Index?
               that are ubiquitous in eastern boundary upwelling system
               studies. While generally valuable first-order descriptions,
               these indices and their underlying theory provide an incomplete

               important zooplankton, from the nutrient-rich waters of the
               modern Southern Ocean. Foraminifera were collected from net tows
               in the Subantarctic and Polar Frontal Zones (SAZ and PFZ,
               respectively) south of Africa during winter 2015 and late summer
               2016. In late summer, consistent with preferential uptake of
               14N-nitrate and the progressive, northward depletion of nitrate
               by phytoplankton across the Southern Ocean, foraminifer tissue
               and shell-bound $\delta$15N rise equatorward along with nitrate
               $\delta$15N. However, foraminifer $\delta$15N is ~3? lower than
               expected for heterotrophs relying on photosynthetic biomass
               generated directly from nitrate. This discrepancy appears to
               originate with the particulate organic N (PON) in late-summer
               surface waters, the $\delta$15N of which is lowered by ammonium
               recycling. In winter, when overall productivity and foraminifer
               production are reduced, foraminifer $\delta$15N is higher (by
               4.6 $\pm$ 0.8? for tissue and by 4.0 $\pm$ 1.5? for shell-bound
               N compared to late summer) and exhibits no clear north-south
               trend. These characteristics can also be explained by the
               feeding-driven connection of foraminifera to PON, which is
               elevated in $\delta$15N by net degradation in winter. Therefore,
               foraminifer $\delta$15N is more closely tied to PON $\delta$15N
               than to nitrate $\delta$15N in the Southern Ocean mixed layer.
               Combining our isotope data with previously reported sediment
               trap fluxes from the western Pacific SAZ/PFZ suggests that,
               under modern conditions, the late-summer ammonium recycling
               signal outweighs that of wintertime decomposition on the

               foraminifera, while relatively few studies have investigated
               B/Ca in species that lack large dinoflagellate symbionts. For
               the first time, we use a sediment trap time series to evaluate
               B/Ca of subtropical and subpolar planktonic foraminifera species
               that are asymbiotic (Globigerina bulloides and Neogloboquadrina
               incompta) and a species that hosts small intrashell
               photosymbionts (Neogloboquadrina dutertrei). We find that B/Ca
               measurements across size fractions indicate overall little to no
               size-dependent uptake of boron that has previously been reported
               in some symbiont-bearing foraminifera. Neogloboquadrina incompta
               and N. dutertrei B/Ca are strongly correlated with calcite

              remain a major challenge to our understanding of the carbon cycle
              and the climate system. Leading hypotheses put forward to explain
              glacial-interglacial atmospheric CO2 variations invoke changes in
              deep-ocean carbon storage, probably modulated by processes in the
              Southern Ocean, where much of the deep ocean is ventilated. A
              central aspect of such models is that, during deglaciations, an
              isolated glacial deep-ocean carbon reservoir is reconnected with
              the atmosphere, driving the atmospheric CO2 rise observed in
              ice-core records. However, direct documentation of changes in
              surface ocean carbon content and the associated transfer of
              carbon to the atmosphere during deglaciations has been hindered
              by the lack of proxy reconstructions that unambiguously reflect
              the oceanic carbonate system. Radiocarbon activity tracks changes
              in ocean ventilation, but not in ocean carbon content, whereas
              proxies that record increased deglacial upwelling do not
              constrain the proportion of upwelled carbon that is degassed
              relative to that which is taken up by the biological pump. Here
              we apply the boron isotope pH proxy in planktic foraminifera to
              two sediment cores from the sub-Antarctic Atlantic and the
              eastern equatorial Pacific as a more direct tracer of oceanic CO2

              partly derive from deep water upwelled in the Southern Ocean,
              became a significant source of carbon to the atmosphere during
              the last deglaciation, when the concentration of atmospheric CO2
              was increasing. This oceanic CO2 outgassing supports the view
              that the ventilation of a deep-ocean carbon reservoir in the
              Southern Ocean had a key role in the deglacial CO2 rise, although
              our results allow for the possibility that processes operating in
              other regions may also have been important for the
              glacial-interglacial ocean-atmosphere exchange of carbon.",

               to 53 million years ago), was the warmest interval of the past
               65 million years, with mean annual surface air temperature over
               ten degrees Celsius warmer than during the pre-industrial
               period. Subsequent global cooling in the middle and late Eocene
               epoch, especially at high latitudes, eventually led to
               continental ice sheet development in Antarctica in the early
               Oligocene epoch (about 33.6 million years ago). However,
               existing estimates place atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels
               during the Eocene at 500-3,000 parts per million, and in the
               absence of tighter constraints carbon-climate interactions over
               this interval remain uncertain. Here we use recent analytical
               and methodological developments to generate a new high-fidelity
               record of CO2 concentrations using the boron isotope
               ($\delta$(11)B) composition of well preserved planktonic
               foraminifera from the Tanzania Drilling Project, revising
               previous estimates. Although species-level uncertainties make
               absolute values difficult to constrain, CO2 concentrations
               during the EECO were around 1,400 parts per million. The
               relative decline in CO2 concentration through the Eocene is more
               robustly constrained at about fifty per cent, with a further
               decline into the Oligocene. Provided the latitudinal dependency
               of sea surface temperature change for a given climate forcing in
               the Eocene was similar to that of the late Quaternary period,
               this CO2 decline was sufficient to drive the well documented
               high- and low-latitude cooling that occurred through the Eocene.
               Once the change in global temperature between the pre-industrial
               period and the Eocene caused by the action of all known slow
               feedbacks (apart from those associated with the carbon cycle) is
               removed, both the EECO and the late Eocene exhibit an
               equilibrium climate sensitivity relative to the pre-industrial
               period of 2.1 to 4.6 degrees Celsius per CO2 doubling (66 per
               cent confidence), which is similar to the canonical range (1.5
               to 4.5 degrees Celsius), indicating that a large fraction of the
               warmth of the early Eocene greenhouse was driven by increased
               CO2 concentrations, and that climate sensitivity was relatively
               constant throughout this period.",

              the mean phenotype in a population, which may buffer the negative
              effects of global change. However, little is known about how
              phenotypic plasticity evolves across multiple generations. We
              tested this by reciprocally-transplanting the polychaete
              Ophryotrocha labronica between control and global change
              scenarios (ocean warming and acidification in isolation and

              it possible to identify general relationships between blue mussel

              were more elongated, narrower and with more parallel dorsoventral
              margins at lower salinities. Temperature and food supply,

              ``Relative Penis Size Index'' (RPSI)--an important imposex
              assessment index--varies seasonally and spatially in the same
              sampling site and how this can affect results obtained in imposex
              monitoring programmes. Animals able to reproduce were found every
              month but a seasonal pattern in N. lapillus reproductive cycle
              was evident. Female gametogenic maturation varied seasonally and
              a decrease in capsule gland volume and condition factor occurred
              in late summer/early autumn. The gametogenesis in males did not
              show a significant seasonal variation as in females but the
              condition factor, penis length, amount of sperm and prostate
              volume also diminished in late summer/early autumn. On the other
              hand, males that were close to egg capsules clusters had larger
              penises than those far away from clusters. The temporal and
              spatial male penis length variation introduces a bias on imposex
              assessment results when using RPSI and the magnitude of the error
              involved is evaluated for different TBT pollution levels
              scenarios. We consider that RPSI provides interesting and
              complementary information that should not be excluded from
              monitoring programmes, but temporal or spatial comparisons of
              imposex should be based on other more reliable imposex indices
              like the VDSI.",

              high concentrations of magnesium prevent spontaneous nucleation

              group of calcifying organisms and generally produce calcite with
              a low Mg content, indicating that they actively remove Mg(2+)
              from vacuolized seawater before calcite precipitation. However,
              one order of foraminifera has evolved a calcification pathway, by
              which it produces calcite with a very high Mg content, suggesting
              that these species do not alter the Mg/Ca ratio of vacuolized
              seawater considerably. The cellular mechanism that makes it
              possible to precipitate calcite at high Mg concentrations,
              however, has remained unknown. Here we demonstrate that they are
              able to elevate the pH at the site of calcification by at least
              one unit above seawater pH and, thereby, overcome
              precipitation-inhibition at ambient Mg concentrations. A similar

              low Mg concentration, suggesting that elevating the pH at the
              site of calcification is a widespread strategy among foraminifera
              to promote calcite precipitation. Since the common ancestor of
              these two groups dates back to the Cambrian, our results would
              imply that this physiological mechanism has evolved over half a
              billion years ago. Since foraminifera rely on elevating the
              intracellular pH for their calcification, our results show that

               Short-term variability thus decreases the number of heat

              understood and harnessed, could enable the rational design of
              synthesis pathways toward or away from metastable structures.
              Crystallization of metastable phases is particularly accessible
              via low-temperature solution-based routes, such as chimie douce
              and hydrothermal synthesis, but although the chemistry of the
              solution plays a crucial role in governing which polymorph forms,
              how it does so is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate an ab
              initio technique to quantify thermodynamic parameters of surfaces
              and bulks in equilibrium with an aqueous environment, enabling
              the calculation of nucleation barriers of competing polymorphs as
              a function of solution chemistry, thereby predicting the solution
              conditions governing polymorph selection. We apply this approach
              to resolve the long-standing ``calcite-aragonite problem''--the
              observation that calcium carbonate precipitates as the metastable
              aragonite polymorph in marine environments, rather than the

              biomineralization, carbon sequestration, paleogeochemistry, and
              the vulnerability of marine life to ocean acidification. We
              identify a direct relationship between the calcite surface energy
              and solution Mg:Ca [corrected] ion concentrations, showing that
              the calcite nucleation barrier surpasses that of metastable
              aragonite in solutions with Mg:Ca ratios consistent with modern
              seawater, allowing aragonite to dominate the kinetics of
              nucleation. Our ability to quantify how solution parameters

              Earth's orbitally paced ice age cycles intensified, lengthened
              from ∼40,000 (∼40 ky) to ∼100 ky, and became distinctly
              asymmetrical. Testing hypotheses that implicate changing
              atmospheric CO2 levels as a driver of the MPT has proven
              difficult with available observations. Here, we use orbitally
              resolved, boron isotope CO2 data to show that the glacial to
              interglacial CO2 difference increased from ∼43 to ∼75 $\mu$atm
              across the MPT, mainly because of lower glacial CO2 levels.
              Through carbon cycle modeling, we attribute this decline
              primarily to the initiation of substantive dust-borne iron
              fertilization of the Southern Ocean during peak glacial stages.
              We also observe a twofold steepening of the relationship between
              sea level and CO2-related climate forcing that is suggestive of a
              change in the dynamics that govern ice sheet stability, such as
              that expected from the removal of subglacial regolith or
              interhemispheric ice sheet phase-locking. We argue that neither
              ice sheet dynamics nor CO2 change in isolation can explain the
              MPT. Instead, we infer that the MPT was initiated by a change in
              ice sheet dynamics and that longer and deeper post-MPT ice ages
              were sustained by carbon cycle feedbacks related to dust
              fertilization of the Southern Ocean as a consequence of larger
              ice sheets.",

               barnacles and mussels, taking from several hours to days to
               handle each prey item. Consequently, marked snails can be
               followed daily and accurate diet histories compiled. Such

               settling times are not considered, and as such, physiological
               responses caused by handling may become additive with those of
               experimental treatments. This study investigated the effect of
               different handling procedures on the acute physiological
               responses of green shore crab (Carcinus maenas). Handling, such
               as would occur during transport around a research facility or
               transfer during experimental procedure, was designated as light
               (10 min emersion) or severe (10 min emersion with shaking).
               Oxygen consumption (MO2) and haemolymph glucose and haemolymph
               L-lactate concentrations were elevated post-handling, the
               magnitude of the change related to the severity of handling
               stress. Glucose and L-lactate concentrations peaked within 1 h
               and returned to basal levels within 6 h, but MO2 remained
               elevated for 10 h, reflecting the additional energy required to
               oxidize L-lactate and replenish energy reserves. Differences
               between light and severe handling treatments showed that
               vibration (shaking) was a major contributor to the stress
               response, rather than the experimental emersion. This was
               confirmed in a second experiment where crabs were handled
               without emersion, and MO2 remained elevated for 14 h. In this
               experiment, the most pronounced increase in MO2 and metabolic
               parameters occurred in crabs that were physically touched and
               moved rapidly from the holding to experimental tanks. Here the
               touch, as well as vibration and visual stimuli, provoked a
               fight-flight response in the crabs. Stress responses were also
               evident in crabs gently transferred by containers. The fact that
               transferring crabs with no physical touching and minimal visual
               and vibrational stimuli still evoked a stress response, albeit
               less pronounced, supports a recommendation that crustaceans
               should be left to settle in the apparatus for at least 12 h
               after handling before experimental procedures are initiated.",

               the distribution of HCO3 ? and CO3 2? near the shell, showed
               that the carbonate system in the vicinity of O. universa was
               significantly different from conditions in the surrounding
               seawater, both in light and darkness, due to the metabolism of
               the foraminifer and its associated algae. Experimental
               light?dark cycles indicated a sufficient CO2 supply sustaining
               high carbon fixation rates of the symbiotic algae via conversion
               of HCO3 ? or via CO2 release from calcification and host
               respiration. Our findings on irradiance-dependent CO2 and pH

               hindcast simulations with an eddy-resolving ocean biogeochemical
               model forced with observation-based variations of wind and
               fluxes of heat and freshwater. We find that domain-wide pH and
               in the top 60 m of the water column decreased significantly over
               these three decades by about −0.02 decade−1 and −0.12 decade−1,
               respectively. In the nearshore areas of northern California and
               Oregon, ocean acidification is reconstructed to have progressed
               much more rapidly, with rates up to 30\% higher than the
               domain-wide trends. Furthermore, ocean acidification penetrated
               substantially into the thermocline, causing a significant
               domain-wide shoaling of the aragonite saturation depth of on
               average −33 m decade−1 and up to −50 m decade−1 in the nearshore
               area of northern California. This resulted in a coast-wide
               increase in nearly undersaturated waters and the appearance of
               waters with , leading to a substantial reduction of habitat
               suitability. Averaged over the whole domain, the main driver of
               these trends is the oceanic uptake of anthropogenic CO2 from the
               atmosphere. However, recent changes in the climatic forcing have
               substantially modulated these trends regionally. This is
               particularly evident in the nearshore regions, where the total
               trends in pH are up to 50\% larger and trends in and in the
               aragonite saturation depth are even twice to three times larger
               than the purely atmospheric CO2-driven trends. This modulation
               in the nearshore regions is a result of the recent marked
               increase in alongshore wind stress, which brought elevated
               levels of dissolved inorganic carbon to the surface via
               upwelling. Our results demonstrate that changes in the climatic
               forcing need to be taken into consideration in future

  title    = "Multistressor impacts of warming and acidification of the ocean
              on marine invertebrates' life histories",
  author   = "Byrne, Maria and Przeslawski, Rachel",
  abstract = "Benthic marine invertebrates live in a multistressor world where
              stressor levels are, and will continue to be, exacerbated by
              global warming and increased atmospheric carbon dioxide. These
              changes are causing the oceans to warm, decrease in pH, become
              hypercapnic, and to become less saturated in carbonate minerals.
              These stressors have strong impacts on biological processes, but
              little is known about their combined effects on the development
              of marine invertebrates. Increasing temperature has a stimulatory
              effect on development, whereas hypercapnia can depress
              developmental processes. The pH, pCO2, and CaCO3 of seawater
              change simultaneously with temperature, challenging our ability
              to predict future outcomes for marine biota. The need to consider
              both warming and acidification is reflected in the recent
              increase in cross-factorial studies of the effects of these
              stressors on development of marine invertebrates. The outcomes
              and trends in these studies are synthesized here. Based on this
              compilation, significant additive or antagonistic effects of
              warming and acidification of the ocean are common (16 of 20
              species studied), and synergistic negative effects also are
              reported. Fertilization can be robust to near-future warming and
              acidification, depending on the male-female mating pair. Although
              larvae and juveniles of some species tolerate near-future levels
              of warming and acidification (+2°C/pH 7.8), projected far-future
              conditions (ca. $\geq$4°C/ $\leq$pH 7.6) are widely deleterious,
              with a reduction in the size and survival of larvae. It appears
              that larvae that calcify are sensitive both to warming and
              acidification, whereas those that do not calcify are more
              sensitive to warming. Different sensitivities of life-history
              stages and species have implications for persistence and
              community function in a changing ocean. Some species are more
              resilient than others and may be potential ``winners'' in the
              climate-change stakes. As the ocean will change more gradually
              over coming decades than in ``future shock'' perturbation
              investigations, it is likely that some species, particularly
              those with short generation times, may be able to tolerate

              generated by approaches like RAD sequencing. However, few
              empirical studies have directly compared the ability of these
              methods to resolve population structure. This could have
              implications for understanding phenotypic plasticity, as many

              RAD sequencing to resolve fine-scale population structure in a
              commercially important benthic invertebrate by genotyping great
              scallops (Pecten maximus) from nine populations around Northern

              structure, yielding higher Fst values and support for two
              distinct genetic clusters, whereas only one cluster could be
              detected in a Bayesian analysis of the microsatellite dataset.
              Furthermore, appreciable phenotypic variation was observed in

              susceptibilities to dissolution. Here, we show how dissolution

               standard laboratory conditions, any behavioural differences
               among the experimental populations could reasonably be inferred
               to be linked to some genetically based mechanism. In order to
               forage, the dogwhelks had to leave a refugium, traverse empty
               'habitat' and enter a patch of mussels serving as prey. Wave
               action markedly depressed foraging activity, increased foraging
               latency and lowered the patch-residence-time index. Dogwhelks
               derived from populations naturally occurring on shores exposed
               to wave action reduced their foraging activity less strongly
               than those derived from sheltered-shore populations, but
               geographical origin (Plymouth or Anglesey) had no significant
               influence on foraging behaviour. A simple interpretation was
               offered, linking the differential behavioural response to
               habitat-specific shell morphology, known to be heritable.
               According to this interpretation, all dogwhelks react similarly
               to the drag forces generated by wave action, but the relatively
               shorter-spired shells of exposed-shore dogwhelks cause weaker
               resultant forces than the taller-spired shells of
               sheltered-shore individuals. Consequently, exposed-shore
               dogwhelks tolerate higher levels of wave action than
               sheltered-shore morphs before suppressing their foraging
               behaviour. As exposed-shore dogwhelks have greater tenacity
               associated with relatively larger pedal area, the increased
               tolerance of wave action extends opportunities for foraging
               without incurring extra risk of dislodgement. The
               sheltered-shore morphology, which imparts greater resistance to
               desiccation, coincidentally increases drag and so makes
               dogwhelks more likely to seek refuge during occasional periods
               of heavy wave action. Exposed- and sheltered-shore morphologies
               therefore represent genotype/environment interaction that is
               apparently adaptive, in part, through its effect on foraging
               behaviour.",

              population and species persistence often require estimates of how

              on constant temperatures. Here, we tested the hypothesis that
              time-averaged population growth rates in fluctuating thermal
              environments differ from growth rates in constant conditions as a
              consequence of Jensen's inequality, and that the thermal

               relevant results are obtained and communicated, a task that
               requires organizing, evaluating, analysing and unambiguously
               communicating the significance of data. In this context, working
               with ecological data, reflecting the complexities and
               interactions of the natural world, can be a challenge. Recent
               innovations for statistical analysis of multifaceted
               interrelated data make obtaining more accurate and meaningful
               results possible, but key decisions of the analyses to use, and
               which components to present in a scientific paper or report, may
               be overwhelming. We offer a 10-step protocol to streamline
               analysis of data that will enhance understanding of the data,
               the statistical models and the results, and optimize
               communication with the reader with respect to both the procedure
               and the outcomes. The protocol takes the investigator from study
               design and organization of data (formulating relevant questions,
               visualizing data collection, data exploration, identifying
               dependency), through conducting analysis (presenting, fitting
               and validating the model) and presenting output (numerically and
               visually), to extending the model via simulation. Each step
               includes procedures to clarify aspects of the data that affect
               statistical analysis, as well as guidelines for written
               presentation. Steps are illustrated with examples using data

              microstructures and architectures. The fully formed shell is
              composed of calcite or aragonite. These CaCO3 crystals form
              complex biocomposites with proteins, which although typically
              less than 5\% of total shell mass, play significant roles in
              determining shell microstructure. Despite much research effort,
              large knowledge gaps remain in how molluscs construct and
              maintain their shells, and how they produce such a great
              diversity of forms. Here we synthesize results on how shell
              shape, microstructure, composition and organic content vary
              among, and within, species in response to numerous biotic and
              abiotic factors. At the local level, temperature, food supply and
              predation cues significantly affect shell morphology, whilst
              salinity has a much stronger influence across latitudes.
              Moreover, we emphasize how advances in genomic technologies [e.g.
              restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-Seq) and
              epigenetics] allow detailed examinations of whether morphological
              changes result from phenotypic plasticity or genetic adaptation,
              or a combination of these. RAD-Seq has already identified single
              nucleotide polymorphisms associated with temperature and
              aquaculture practices, whilst epigenetic processes have been
              shown significantly to modify shell construction to local
              conditions in, for example, Antarctica and New Zealand. We also
              synthesize results on the costs of shell construction and explore
              how these affect energetic trade-offs in animal metabolism. The
              cellular costs are still debated, with CaCO3 precipitation
              estimates ranging from 1-2 J/mg to 17-55 J/mg depending on
              experimental and environmental conditions. However, organic
              components are more expensive (~29 J/mg) and recent data indicate
              transmembrane calcium ion transporters can involve considerable
              costs. This review emphasizes the role that molecular analyses
              have played in demonstrating multiple evolutionary origins of
              biomineralization genes. Although these are characterized by
              lineage-specific proteins and unique combinations of co-opted
              genes, a small set of protein domains have been identified as a
              conserved biomineralization tool box. We further highlight the
              use of sequence data sets in providing candidate genes for in
              situ localization and protein function studies. The former has
              elucidated gene expression modularity in mantle tissue, improving
              understanding of the diversity of shell morphology synthesis. RNA
              interference (RNAi) and clustered regularly interspersed short
              palindromic repeats - CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR-Cas9)
              experiments have provided proof of concept for use in the
              functional investigation of mollusc gene sequences, showing for
              example that Pif (aragonite-binding) protein plays a significant
              role in structured nacre crystal growth and that the Lsdia1 gene
              sets shell chirality in Lymnaea stagnalis. Much research has
              focused on the impacts of ocean acidification on molluscs.
              Initial studies were predominantly pessimistic for future
              molluscan biodiversity. However, more sophisticated experiments
              incorporating selective breeding and multiple generations are
              identifying subtle effects and that variability within mollusc
              genomes has potential for adaption to future conditions.
              Furthermore, we highlight recent historical studies based on
              museum collections that demonstrate a greater resilience of
              molluscs to climate change compared with experimental data. The
              future of mollusc research lies not solely with ecological
              investigations into biodiversity, and this review synthesizes
              knowledge across disciplines to understand biomineralization. It
              spans research ranging from evolution and development, through
              predictions of biodiversity prospects and future-proofing of

               studies. The former has elucidated gene expression modularity in
               mantle tissue, improving understanding of the diversity of shell
               morphology synthesis. RNA interference (RNAi) and clustered
               regularly interspersed short palindromic repeats -
               CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR-Cas9) experiments have
               provided proof of concept for use in the functional
               investigation of mollusc gene sequences, showing for example
               that Pif (aragonite-binding) protein plays a significant role in
               structured nacre crystal growth and that the Lsdia1 gene sets
               shell chirality in Lymnaea stagnalis. Much research has focused
               on the impacts of ocean acidification on molluscs. Initial
               studies were predominantly pessimistic for future molluscan
               biodiversity. However, more sophisticated experiments
               incorporating selective breeding and multiple generations are
               identifying subtle effects and that variability within mollusc
               genomes has potential for adaption to future conditions.
               Furthermore, we highlight recent historical studies based on
               museum collections that demonstrate a greater resilience of
               molluscs to climate change compared with experimental data. The
               future of mollusc research lies not solely with ecological
               investigations into biodiversity, and this review synthesizes
               knowledge across disciplines to understand biomineralization. It
               spans research ranging from evolution and development, through

               a mussel farm on the West coast of Scotland. A single nuclear
               marker (Me15/16) and a novel panel of 33 MT-diagnostic single

              Both genetic evolution in reaction norm elevation and plasticity

              If the phenotypic variance increases with plasticity through the

               Baltic Sea) is a brackish (12-20 g kg(-1) ) and CO2 enriched

               chiefly depend on food supply, with only minor impacts of pCO2
               up to 3350 $\mu$atm. Kiel Fjord was characterized by strong
               seasonal pCO2 variability. During summer, maximal pCO2 values of
               2500 $\mu$atm were observed at the surface and >3000 $\mu$atm at
               the bottom. However, the field growth experiment revealed seven
               times higher growth and calcification rates of M. edulis at a
               high pCO2 inner fjord field station (mean pCO2 ca. 1000
               $\mu$atm) in comparison to a low pCO2 outer fjord station (ca.
               600 $\mu$atm). In addition, mussels were able to out-compete the
               barnacle Amphibalanus improvisus at the high pCO2 site. High
               mussel productivity at the inner fjord site was enabled by
               higher particulate organic carbon concentrations. Kiel Fjord is
               highly impacted by eutrophication, which causes bottom water
               hypoxia and consequently high seawater pCO2 . At the same time,
               elevated nutrient concentrations increase the energy
               availability for filter feeding organisms such as mussels. Thus,
               M. edulis can dominate over a seemingly more acidification
               resistant species such as A. improvisus. We conclude that
               benthic stages of M. edulis tolerate high ambient pCO2 when food

              of 228 studies examining biological responses to ocean
              acidification. The results reveal decreased survival,
              calcification, growth, development and abundance in response to
              acidification when the broad range of marine organisms is pooled
              together. However, the magnitude of these responses varies among
              taxonomic groups, suggesting there is some predictable
              trait-based variation in sensitivity, despite the investigation
              of approximately 100 new species in recent research. The results

              suggest that an enhanced sensitivity of early life history stages

               be affected by thermal, salinity and pH stress. (4) Interaction
               types vary among stressors, ontogenetic stages and biological
               responses, but they are more consistent among phyla. (5) Ocean
               acidification is a greater stressor for calcifying than
               noncalcifying larvae. Despite being more ecologically realistic

  abstract = "Although geographical patterns of species' sensitivity to
              environmental changes are defined by interacting multiple
              stressors, little is known about compensatory processes shaping
              regional differences in organismal vulnerability. Here, we
              examine large-scale spatial variations in biomineralization under
              heterogeneous environmental gradients of temperature, salinity
              and food availability across a 30° latitudinal range (3,334 km),
              to test whether plasticity in calcareous shell production and
              composition, from juveniles to large adults, mediates
              geographical patterns of resilience to climate change in critical
              foundation species, the mussels Mytilus edulis and M. trossulus.
              We find shell calcification decreased towards high latitude, with
              mussels producing thinner shells with a higher organic content in
              polar than temperate regions. Salinity was the best predictor of
              within-region differences in mussel shell deposition, mineral and
              organic composition. In polar, subpolar, and Baltic low-salinity
              environments, mussels produced thin shells with a thicker
              external organic layer (periostracum), and an increased
              proportion of calcite (prismatic layer, as opposed to aragonite)
              and organic matrix, providing potentially higher resistance
              against dissolution in more corrosive waters. Conversely, in
              temperate, higher salinity regimes, thicker, more calcified
              shells with a higher aragonite (nacreous layer) proportion were
              deposited, which suggests enhanced protection under increased
              predation pressure. Interacting effects of salinity and food
              availability on mussel shell composition predict the deposition
              of a thicker periostracum and organic-enriched prismatic layer
              under forecasted future environmental conditions, suggesting a
              capacity for increased protection of high-latitude populations
              from ocean acidification. These findings support
              biomineralization plasticity as a potentially advantageous
              compensatory mechanism conferring Mytilus species a protective
              capacity for quantitative and qualitative trade-offs in shell
              deposition as a response to regional alterations of abiotic and
              biotic conditions in future environments. Our work illustrates
              that compensatory mechanisms, driving plastic responses to the
              spatial structure of multiple stressors, can define geographical

               blooms and carbon and nutrient cycles in the marine domain, to
               assess the dual role of changing nutrient loads and increasing
               atmospheric CO2 as drivers of air?sea CO2 exchanges in the
               Southern North Sea with a focus on the Belgian coastal zone
               (BCZ). The whole area, submitted to the influence of two main
               rivers (Seine and Scheldt), is characterized by variable diatom
               and Phaeocystis colonies blooms which impact on the trophic
               status and air?sea CO2 fluxes of the coastal ecosystem. For this
               application, the MIRO-CO2 model is implemented in a 0D multibox
               frame covering the eutrophied Eastern English Channel and
               Southern North Sea and receiving loads from the rivers Seine and
               Scheldt. Model simulations are performed for the period between
               1951 and 1998 using real forcing fields for sea surface
               temperature, wind speed and atmospheric CO2 and RIVERSTRAHLER
               simulations for river carbon and nutrient loads. Model results
               suggest that the BCZ shifted from a source of CO2 before 1970
               (low eutrophication) towards a sink during the 1970?1990 period
               when anthropogenic DIN and P loads increased, stimulating C
               fixation by autotrophs. In agreement, a shift from net annual
               heterotrophy towards autotrophy in BCZ is simulated from 1980.
               The period after 1990 is characterized by a progressive decrease
               of P loads concomitant with a decrease of primary production and
               of the CO2 sink in the BCZ. At the end of the simulation period,
               the BCZ ecosystem is again net heterotroph and acts as a source
               of CO2 to the atmosphere. R-MIRO-CO2 scenarios testing the
               relative impact of temperature, wind speed, atmospheric CO2 and
               river loads variability on the simulated air?sea CO2 fluxes
               suggest that the trend in air?sea CO2 fluxes simulated between
               1951 and 1998 in the BCZ was mainly controlled by the magnitude
               and the ratio of inorganic nutrient river loads. Quantitative
               nutrient changes control the level of primary production while
               qualitative changes modulate the relative contribution of
               diatoms and Phaeocystis to this flux and hence the sequestration

              decreased with latitude, decreasing seawater temperature, and

              pollution during the 1970s and 1980s, when local populations
              became extinct. After a partial ban on TBT in the United Kingdom
              in 1987, vacant sites have been recolonized. N. lapillus lacks a
              planktonic larval stage and is therefore expected to have limited
              dispersal ability. Relatively fast recolonization of some sites,
              however, contradicts this assumption. We compared levels of
              genetic diversity and genetic structuring between recolonized
              sites and sites that showed continuous population at three
              localities across the British Isles. No significant genetic

               species were found in the communities from Wollongong Harbour
               compared to only 40 in those from Port Kembla Harbour.
               Twenty-eight species (including many bryozoans) occurred only in
               the former, while 15 species occurred solely in the latter. Ten
               of the 25 species common to both areas were more numerous in
               Port Kembla Harbour, probably because of the greater
               availability of free substratum and food in this area. The
               species richness of fouling communities in Port Kembla Harbour
               was found to decrease as pollutant concentrations increased. In
               both study areas, communities established in summer showed
               significantly higher species richness than those whose
               development was initiated in winter. This difference was less
               pronounced in Port Kembla Harbour and was attributed to the
               effects of pollution on larval settlement. Although species
               richness increased at all sites through time, Wollongong Harbour
               communities contained a greater number of species at the end of
               the experiment than communities from Port Kembla Harbour.
               Despite this, fewer species were found in the very early
               developmental stages of the communities from Wollongong Harbour.

               very different from that in Wollongong Harbour, involving
               different types of species. In addition, the classification
               identified a secondary pattern in the data which showed that the
               species composition of the Port Kembla Harbour communities
               changed with time, independently of any seasonal effects. A
               principal coordinate analysis of the data was able to further
               expand on these findings. It demonstrated that the succession of
               fouling communities in Port Kembla Harbour involved a process
               whereby one group of species (ascidians) was gradually replaced
               through time by a second group of different species (bivalves).
               In contrast, the communities in Wollongong Harbour were
               dominated by inhibitory interactions. The succession in this

  abstract  = "Summary.? Recent work by Reiss and Ogden provides a theoretical
               basis for sometimes preferring restricted maximum likelihood
               (REML) to generalized cross-validation (GCV) for smoothing
               parameter selection in semiparametric regression. However,
               existing REML or marginal likelihood (ML) based methods for
               semiparametric generalized linear models (GLMs) use iterative
               REML or ML estimation of the smoothing parameters of working
               linear approximations to the GLM. Such indirect schemes need not
               converge and fail to do so in a non-negligible proportion of
               practical analyses. By contrast, very reliable prediction error
               criteria smoothing parameter selection methods are available,
               based on direct optimization of GCV, or related criteria, for
               the GLM itself. Since such methods directly optimize properly
               defined functions of the smoothing parameters, they have much
               more reliable convergence properties. The paper develops the
               first such method for REML or ML estimation of smoothing
               parameters. A Laplace approximation is used to obtain an
               approximate REML or ML for any GLM, which is suitable for
               efficient direct optimization. This REML or ML criterion
               requires that Newton?Raphson iteration, rather than Fisher
               scoring, be used for GLM fitting, and a computationally stable
               approach to this is proposed. The REML or ML criterion itself is
               optimized by a Newton method, with the derivatives required
               obtained by a mixture of implicit differentiation and direct
               methods. The method will cope with numerical rank deficiency in
               the fitted model and in fact provides a slight improvement in
               numerical robustness on the earlier method of Wood for
               prediction error criteria based smoothness selection. Simulation
               results suggest that the new REML and ML methods offer some
               improvement in mean-square error performance relative to GCV or
               Akaike's information criterion in most cases, without the small
               number of severe undersmoothing failures to which Akaike's
               information criterion and GCV are prone. This is achieved at the
               same computational cost as GCV or Akaike's information
               criterion. The new approach also eliminates the convergence
               failures of previous REML- or ML-based approaches for penalized
               GLMs and usually has lower computational cost than these
               alternatives. Example applications are presented in adaptive
               smoothing, scalar on function regression and generalized
               additive model selection.",

              reduced variance in fitness can invade a population consisting of
              individuals that on average do better. Such strategies 'hedge
              their evolutionary bets' against the variability of the
              environment. The idea of bet-hedging arises from the fact that
              appropriate measure of long-term fitness is sensitive to
              variance, leading to the potential for strategies with a reduced
              mean fitness to invade and increase in frequency. Our aim is to
              review the conceptual foundation of bet-hedging as a mechanism
              that influences short- and long-term evolutionary processes. We
              do so by presenting a general model showing how evolutionary
              changes are affected by variance in fitness and how genotypic
              variance in fitness can be separated into variance in fitness at
              the level of the individuals and correlations in fitness among
              them. By breaking down genotypic fitness variance in this way the
              traditional divisions between conservative and diversified
              strategies are more easily intuited, and it is also shown that
              this division can be considered a false dichotomy, and is better
              viewed as two extreme points on a continuum. The model also sheds
              light on the ideas of within- and between-generation bet-hedging,
              which can also be generalized to be seen as two ends of a
              different continuum. We use a simple example to illustrate the
              virtues of our general model, as well as discuss the implications

               may play some part in producing the pigment for colour. However
               white and banded forms are often found in otherwise coloured
               colonies. This study describes the classification for colour and
               banding of 83,524 whelks from 444 areas around the British Isles
               and west Atlantic coast. Colour and banding were significantly
               correlated r=0.45$\pm$0.05). Because of the possible involvement
               of diet in shell colour, attention has been confined to banded
               forms. No obvious pattern in distribution could be discerned.
               Possible factors affecting the occurrence and incidence of
               banding are: climate; geology; exposure to wave action;
               predation; intra- or interspecific competition; cryptic

               which was definitely associated with banding frequency was
               exposure (r= 0.33$\pm$0.05), but there were so many exceptions
               to the correlation (e.g. highly exposed populations which were

               occur in brachiopods, gastropods and terrestrial hermit crabs,
               and to a lesser extent in scaphopods and cephalopods. Internal
               whorl resorption leading to a more compact visceral mass has
               evolved at least ten times in gastropods. Contrary to
               expectations stemming from patterns in the availability of
               calcium, gastropod remodelling is a phenomenon of warm,
               calcium-rich environments and not of cold acidified conditions.
               There is therefore no evidence that internal whorl resorption
               increases calcium-use efficiency. Resorption is one of several
               mechanisms that have enabled animal skeletons to become more
               dynamic and adaptable during ontogeny.",

  title    = "Latitudinal trends in shell production cost from the tropics to
              the poles",
  author   = "Watson, Sue-Ann and Morley, Simon A and Peck, Lloyd S",
  abstract = "The proportion of body mass devoted to skeleton in marine
              invertebrates decreases along latitudinal gradients from large
              proportions in the tropics to small proportions in polar regions.
              A historical hypothesis-that latitudinal differences in shell
              production costs explain these trends-remains untested. Using
              field-collected specimens spanning a 79°N to 68°S latitudinal
              gradient (16,300 km), we conducted a taxonomically controlled
              evaluation of energetic costs of shell production as a proportion
              of the total energy budget in mollusks. Shell production cost was
              fairly low across latitudes at <10\% of the energy budget and
              predominately <5\% in gastropods and <4\% in bivalves. Throughout
              life, shell cost tended to be lower in tropical species and
              increased slightly toward the poles. However, shell cost also
              varied with life stage, with the greatest costs found in young
              tropical gastropods. Low shell production costs on the energy
              budget suggest that shell cost may play only a small role in
              influencing proportional skeleton size gradients across latitudes
              relative to other ecological factors, such as predation in
              present-day oceans. However, any increase in the cost of calcium
              carbonate (CaCO3) deposition, including from ocean acidification,
              may lead to a projected ~50 to 70\% increase in the proportion of
              the total energy budget required for shell production for a
              doubling of the CaCO3 deposition cost. Changes in energy budget
              allocation to shell cost would likely alter ecological trade-offs
              between calcification and other drivers, such as predation, in
              marine ecosystems.",

               important issue. Within the German Environmental Specimen Bank
               (ESB) program blue mussels (Mytilus edulis Complex) are sampled
               regularly since the 1980s. The samples are collected in
               two-monthly intervals at two North Sea sites and in 6-month
               intervals at one Baltic Sea site. All samples from one site and
               year are combined to annual composite samples and archived as
               sub-samples under cryogenic conditions. In order to investigate
               a possible reduction of the number of annual sampling intervals
               while maintaining comparability with the long-term composite
               sample data, the seasonal variability of metals/metalloids was
               analyzed based on the half-yearly and bimonthly samples of 2013,
               2015 and 2017. In mussels from the North Sea site
               Eckwarderhoerne seasonality of metals/metalloids was comparable
               in all 3 years (arsenic being the only exception). At the North
               Sea site Koenigshafen seasonality of cobalt, nickel, cadmium,
               copper, lead, and arsenic was comparable in 2013 and 2015 but
               not in 2017, while selenium showed the same seasonality in all 3
               years. Within 1 year, concentrations of metals and metalloids
               can vary by the same order of magnitude as observed between
               annual composite samples of different years making it impossible
               to select just one representative sampling time point per year
               that would provide the same information as the respective annual
               composite sample. The findings highlight the importance of
               carefully selecting the sampling time point when using mussels
               in biota monitoring. For the German ESB program it is
               recommended to continue with the current sampling strategy and
               analyze annual composite samples in order to maintain
               comparability with the long-term data series, which are a

              chemistry of seawater, with repercussions for marine organisms
              and ecosystems. Current research suggests that calcification will
              decrease in many species, but compelling evidence of impaired
              functional performance of calcium carbonate structures is sparse,
              particularly in key species. Here we demonstrate that ocean
              acidification markedly degrades the mechanical integrity of
              larval shells in the mussel Mytilus californianus, a critical
              community member on rocky shores throughout the northeastern
              Pacific. Larvae cultured in seawater containing CO(2)
              concentrations expected by the year 2100 (540 or 970 ppm)
              precipitated weaker, thinner and smaller shells than individuals
              raised under present-day seawater conditions (380 ppm), and also
              exhibited lower tissue mass. Under a scenario where mussel larvae
              exposed to different CO(2) levels develop at similar rates, these
              trends suggest a suite of potential consequences, including an
              exacerbated vulnerability of new settlers to crushing and
              drilling attacks by predators; poorer larval condition, causing
              increased energetic stress during metamorphosis; and greater
              risks from desiccation at low tide due to shifts in shell area to
              body mass ratios. Under an alternative scenario where responses
              derive exclusively from slowed development, with impacted
              individuals reaching identical milestones in shell strength and
              size by settlement, a lengthened larval phase could increase
              exposure to high planktonic mortality rates. In either case,
              because early life stages operate as population bottlenecks,
              driving general patterns of distribution and abundance, the
              ecological success of this vital species may be tied to how ocean
              acidification proceeds in coming decades.",

              conditions are defined as values that exceed an empirically
              estimated threshold for each variable. We present a 200-day time
              series from June through December 2010 of carbonate chemistry and
              environmental parameters measured on the Heron Island reef flat.
              These data reveal that aragonite saturation state, pH, and pCO2

              dissolved organic carbon (DIC) and total alkalinity (TA), rather

              ranges occurred in austral spring, in October (1.5 - 6.6°C) and
              lowest diel ranges (0.9 - 3.2°C) were observed in July, at the
              peak of winter. We observed large diel total pH variability, with
              a maximum range of 7.7 - 8.5 total pH units, with minimum diel
              average pH values occurring during spring and maximum during
              fall. As with many other reefs, the nighttime pH minima on the
              reef flat were far lower than pH values predicted for the open

              Understanding the impacts of this rapid change in baseline
              carbonate chemistry on marine organisms needs a precise,
              mechanistic understanding of physiological responses to carbonate
              chemistry. Recent experimental work has shown shell development
              and growth in some bivalve larvae, have direct sensitivities to
              calcium carbonate saturation state that is not modulated through
              organismal acid-base chemistry. To understand different modes of
              action of OA on bivalve larvae, we experimentally tested how pH,
              PCO2, and saturation state independently affect shell growth and
              development, respiration rate, and initiation of feeding in
              Mytilus californianus embryos and larvae. We found, as documented
              in other bivalve larvae, that shell development and growth were
              affected by aragonite saturation state, and not by pH or PCO2.
              Respiration rate was elevated under very low pH (~7.4) with no
              change between pH of ~ 8.3 to ~7.8. Initiation of feeding
              appeared to be most sensitive to PCO2, and possibly minor
              response to pH under elevated PCO2. Although different components
              of physiology responded to different carbonate system variables,
              the inability to normally develop a shell due to lower saturation
              state precludes pH or PCO2 effects later in the life history.
              However, saturation state effects during early shell development
              will carry-over to later stages, where pH or PCO2 effects can
              compound OA effects on bivalve larvae. Our findings suggest OA
              may be a multi-stressor unto itself. Shell development and growth
              of the native mussel, M. californianus, was indistinguishable
              from the Mediterranean mussel, Mytilus galloprovincialis,
              collected from the southern U.S. Pacific coast, an area not
              subjected to seasonal upwelling. The concordance in responses
              suggests a fundamental OA bottleneck during development of the
              first shell material affected only by saturation state.",

              water temperature, in laboratory controlled conditions, on the
              last stages of pearl mineralization in order to assess their
              impact on pearl quality. To this end, grafted pearl oysters were
              fed at different levels of food and subjected to different water
              temperatures one month prior to harvest to evaluate the effect of
              these factors on 1) pearl and shell deposition rate, 2)
              expression of genes involved in biomineralization in pearl sacs,
              3) nacre ultrastructure (tablet thickness and number of tablets
              deposited per day) and 4) pearl quality traits. Our results
              revealed that high water temperature stimulates both shell and
              pearl deposition rates. However, low water temperature led to
              thinner nacre tablets, a lower number of tablets deposited per
              day and impacted pearl quality with better luster and fewer
              defects. Conversely, the two tested food level had no significant
              effects on shell and pearl growth, pearl nacre ultrastructure or
              pearl quality. However, one gene, Aspein, was significantly
              downregulated in high food levels. These results will be helpful
              for the pearl industry. A wise strategy to increase pearl quality
              would be to rear pearl oysters at a high water temperature to
              increase pearl growth and consequently pearl size; and to harvest
              pearls after a period of low water temperature to enhance luster

               but may reach up to 6 cm in height (Crothers, 1985). The shell
               colour is variable, usually white, but may be grey, brown, or
               yellow, occasionally with contrasting (usually brown) spiral
               banding. A short, open siphonal canal leads from base of the
               aperture. The outer lip of the aperture is thin in young
               specimens, becoming thickened and toothed internally with age.
               The shell shape, shell thickness and relative size of the
               aperture vary with wave exposure. In some populations, mainly

               the majority of its latitudinal range from Washington to
               southern California, USA. Using long-term (five years),
               high-frequency temperature records recorded at multiple sites,
               we tested the hypothesis that local ?modifying factors? such as
               the timing of low tide in summer can lead to large-scale
               geographic mosaics of body temperature. Our results show that
               patterns of body temperature during aerial exposure at low tide
               vary in physiologically meaningful and often counterintuitive
               ways over large sections of this species' geographic range. We
               evaluated the spatial correlations among sites to explore how
               body temperatures change along the latitudinal gradient, and
               these analyses show that ?hot spots? and ?cold spots? exist
               where temperatures are hotter or colder than expected based on
               latitude. We identified four major hot spots and four cold spots
               along the entire geographic gradient with at least one hot spot
               and one cold spot in each of the three regions examined
               (Washington?Oregon, Central California, and Southern
               California). Temporal autocorrelation analysis of year-to-year
               consistency and temporal predictability in the mussel body
               temperatures revealed that southern animals experience higher
               levels of predictability in thermal signals than northern
               animals. We also explored the role of wave splash at a subset of
               sites and found that, while average daily temperature extremes
               varied between sites with different levels of wave splash,
               yearly extreme temperatures were often similar, as were patterns
               of predictability. Our results suggest that regional patterns of
               tidal regime and local pattern of wave splash can overwhelm
               those of large-scale climate in driving patterns of body
               temperature, leading to complex thermal mosaics of temperature
               rather than simple latitudinal gradients. A narrow focus on
               population changes only at range margins may overlook
               climatically forced local extinctions and other population
               changes at sites well within a species range. Our results

               densities of 23,000 algae per formaminifer. This provides a new

               resembled sun-adapted algae: a saturation intensity (Ik) of 386

  abstract  = "[(1) An isolated population of Nucella lapillus lives on Old
               Den, a pebble bank in the Humber Estuary surrounded by mud. This
               is an unusual habitat for Nucella for it is not normally
               associated either with shingle or mud. (2) Before 1962 Nucella
               relied on Balanus as a food source, but in the period 1962/64
               Balanus was destroyed, and Nucella turned to Cerastoderma edule,
               a thinly-scattered prey washed on to the bank from the mud banks
               which surrounded it. (3) In 1965 Balanus resettled on the bank,
               and Nucella in the area resumed feeding on it. The settlement of
               Balanus induced a considerable emigration of Nucella from areas
               where it fed on Cerastoderma. (4) Nucella feeding on Balanus
               were more contagiously distributed than those feeding on
               Cerastoderma. (5) Nucella seeking Cerastoderma travelled between
               two and three times the distance travelled by Nucella seeking
               Balanus. This was associated with the dispersive behaviour of
               Nucella seeking thinly-scattered prey. (6) Nucella feeding on
               Cerastoderma were more rapacious than those feeding on Balanus.
               It was concluded that the rapacity of Nucella depended on the
               availability of food in the natural environment. (7) When given
               a choice, most Nucella preferred Mytilus as food. (8) Nucella
               accustomed to feeding on cockles in natural conditions readily
               consumed them in the laboratory, unlike barnacle-fed Nucella.
               This trait was partially lost when Nucella were provided with
               Balanus or Mytilus but was regained if cockles were provided in
               the absence of other food organisms. The mechanism involved with
               the acquisition of a taste for a new prey organism may be
               described as associative learning. (9) The efficiency of prey
               penetration in Nucella partly depends on the amount of
               experience gained by the predator.]",

               Responses of the Prey, Nucella lapillus",
  author    = "Hughes, Roger N and Elner, R W",
  abstract  = "[(1) Shore crabs attack dogwhelks by attempting to crush the
               shell. Because of differences in shell morphology, sheltered
               shore dogwhelks tend to be opened by removal of the apex and
               exposed shore dogwhelks by breaking the columella. (2) The
               proportion of successful attacks is unity for small dogwhelks
               but decreases rapidly as the shells grow and become more robust.
               The attack success rate curve begins to fall at a smaller shell
               height in sheltered than in exposed shore dogwhelks. Large adult
               sheltered shore dogwhelks are immune to attack. (3) For large
               male shore crabs preying on sheltered shore dogwhelks, prey
               value (energy yielded per unit handling time) forms a steep
               normal curve when plotted against shell height, peaking at about
               14 mm. Because of the rapidly decreasing attack success rate,
               the prey value of individuals between the optimum and about 27
               mm height is very unpredictable. (4) When presented with an
               abundance of prey in each size category in the laboratory, shore
               crabs did not specialize on the optimal size as predicted by
               optimal foraging theory. All encountered prey were attacked but
               rejected if unbroken after 0.25 to 2.75 minutes. Very small
               dogwhelks were sometimes dropped accidentally. As a result of
               these mechanical processes, optimally sized dogwhelks were the
               most frequently eaten. (5) The foraging tactics seem to be the
               most appropriate for prey types which have unpredictable prey
               values and are sparsely distributed so that encounter rates are
               always low. Most intertidal gastropods are of this type. The
               foraging tactics applied to dogwhelks contrast with those
               applied to mussels where prey value is predictable and encounter
               rates are high. (6) Exposed shore dogwhelks living in the
               virtual absence of shore crabs are much more vulnerable to
               attack than sheltered shore dogwhelks suffering high crab
               predation. Sheltered shore dogwhelks are better protected
               because of a narrower mouth which excludes the chelae of
               attacking crabs and a thicker, more robust shell. These
               attributes were even more pronounced in a sublittoral-fringe
               population of dogwhelks exposed to the more powerful edible
               crab. (7) The narrower mouth of sheltered shore dogwhelks is
               produced by a more elongated spiral growth form. This does not
               reduce the relative size of the visceral mass but it does reduce
               the relative area of the foot. (8) The thicker, more robust
               shell of sheltered shore dogwhelks results in a heavier load per
               g flesh and may represent a metabolic cost of the anti-predator
               adaptation. Such a cost is possibly unimportant because
               sublittoral-fringe dogwhelks frequently carry an extra load of
               encrusting barnacles, without any reduction in relative size of
               the visceral mass or total flesh weight. (9) Selective deaths
               caused by crab predation must occur below a shell height of
               about 27 mm. The most vulnerable stages, below about 14 mm
               height, tend to be inaccessible to crabs because of their
               propensity to remain under stones or within crevices. The habit
               of foraging on the outer surfaces of stones is acquired only by
               large dogwhelks and since many of these will be over 27 mm in
               height, only a few will likely fall prey to shore crabs.]",

               from three populations with different exposure to wave action

               The dogwhelk shells from the sheltered site were stronger, mass
               for mass, than those from the very exposed site. The shells from
               the intermediate site were intermediate. (3) The stronger
               dogwhelk shells, coming from a site where predation pressure is
               almost certainly intense, protected less body mass per unit
               shell mass than did shells from more exposed sites. (4) These
               results confirm quantitatively the suggestion of Hughes \& Elner
               (1979) that sheltered--shore dogwhelks have stronger shells, at
               the same time incurring greater metabolic cost. (5) The winkle
               shells showed little difference between sites. (6) The lack of
               difference between the winkles from different sites is probably
               explained by the greater gene flow, permitted by the winkle's
               pelagic eggs and larvae, smoothing out interpopulation

  abstract  = "Gastropod shells are important antipredator structures that vary
               morphologically in response to predation risk, often increasing
               in thickness when the risk of predation is greater. Because the
               shell is composed of different microstructures that vary in
               energetic cost and strength, shell thickness may be increased in
               different ways. We tested whether the common intertidal snail
               Nucella lapillus differs in microstructure between shores with
               different predation risk, and whether any differences in
               microstructure affect shell strength. Predation risk varies with
               degree of wave exposure, so we compared shell microstructure and
               strength between snails from different exposure regimes. N.
               lapillus shells are made of a strong but energetically expensive
               crossed lamellar microstructure and a weaker but less
               energetically expensive homogeneous microstructure. Independent
               of exposure regime, the homogeneous microstructure was used to
               thicken the shell as snails increase in size. The thickness of
               the stronger crossed-lamellar microstructure changes little with
               snail size or predator risk. Whelks from wave-protected shores,
               where predation risk is high, have much thicker shells than
               conspecifics from exposed shores, where predation risk is low.
               The greater thickness is largely due to a disproportionate
               increase in the thickness of the homogeneous layer, and this
               increase translates into a much stronger shell. The advantage of
               using the weaker microstructure may lie in the fact that it is
               energetically cheaper and can be deposited more quickly,
               allowing snails to grow more rapidly to a size refuge.
               Reinforcing the shell with weaker and energetically cheaper
               materials that allow rapid growth to a size refuge may be a more
               important strategy for reducing the risk of predation than
               simply maximizing strength.",

  abstract  = "Elemental ratios in biogenic marine calcium carbonates are
               widely used in geobiology, environmental science, and
               paleoenvironmental reconstructions. It is generally accepted
               that the elemental abundance of biogenic marine carbonates
               reflects a combination of the abundance of that ion in seawater,
               the physical properties of seawater, the mineralogy of the
               biomineral, and the pathways and mechanisms of
               biomineralization. Here we report measurements of a suite of
               nine elemental ratios (Li/Ca, B/Ca, Na/Ca, Mg/Ca, Zn/Ca, Sr/Ca,
               Cd/Ca, Ba/Ca, and U/Ca) in 18 species of benthic marine
               invertebrates spanning a range of biogenic carbonate polymorph
               mineralogies (low-Mg calcite, high-Mg calcite, aragonite, mixed
               mineralogy) and of phyla (including Mollusca, Echinodermata,
               Arthropoda, Annelida, Cnidaria, Chlorophyta, and Rhodophyta)
               cultured at a single temperature (25°C) and a range of pCO2
               treatments (ca. 409, 606, 903, and 2856 ppm). This dataset was
               used to explore various controls over elemental partitioning in
               biogenic marine carbonates, including species-level and
               biomineralization-pathway-level controls, the influence of
               internal pH regulation compared to external pH changes, and
               biocalcification responses to changes in seawater carbonate
               chemistry. The dataset also enables exploration of broad scale
               phylogenetic patterns of elemental partitioning across
               calcifying species, exhibiting high phylogenetic signals
               estimated from both uni- and multivariate analyses of the
               elemental ratio data (univariate: $\lambda$ = 0--0.889;
               multivariate: $\lambda$ = 0.895--0.99). Comparing partial R2
               values returned from non-phylogenetic and phylogenetic
               regression analyses echo the importance of and show that
               phylogeny explains the elemental ratio data 1.4--59 times better
               than mineralogy in five out of nine of the elements analyzed.
               Therefore, the strong associations between biomineral elemental
               chemistry and species relatedness suggests mechanistic controls
               over element incorporation rooted in the evolution of
               biomineralization mechanisms.",

  abstract = "In coastal temperate regions such as the Baltic Sea, calcifying
              bivalves dominate benthic communities playing a vital ecological
              role in maintaining biodiversity and nutrient recycling. At low
              salinities, bivalves exhibit reduced growth and calcification
              rates which is thought to result from physiological constraints
              associated with osmotic stress. Calcification demands a
              considerable amount of energy in calcifying molluscs and
              estuarine habitats provide sub-optimal conditions for
              calcification due to low concentrations of calcification
              substrates and large variations in carbonate chemistry.
              Therefore, we hypothesize that slow growth rates in estuarine
              bivalves result from increased costs of calcification, rather
              than costs associated with osmotic stress. To investigate this,
              we estimated the cost of calcification for the first time in
              benthic bivalve life stages and the relative energy allocation to
              calcification in three Mytilus populations along the Baltic
              salinity gradient. Our results indicate that calcification rates
              are significantly reduced only in 6 psu populations compared to
              11 and 16 psu populations, coinciding with ca. 2--3-fold higher
              calcification costs at low salinity and temperature. This
              suggests that reduced growth of Baltic Mytilus at low salinities
              results from increased calcification costs rather than osmotic
              stress related costs. We also reveal that shell growth (both
              calcification and shell organic production) demands 31--60\% of
              available assimilated energy from food, which is significantly
              higher than previous estimates. Energetically expensive
              calcification represents a major constraint on growth of mytilids
              in the estuarine and coastal seas where warming, acidification
              and desalination are predicted over the next century.",

  title    = "Physical and Biological Determinants of the Fabrication of
              Molluscan Shell Microstructures",
  author   = "Checa, Antonio G",
  abstract = "Molluscs are grand masters in the fabrication of shells, because
              these are composed of the largest variety of microstructures
              found among invertebrates. Molluscan microstructures are highly
              ordered aggregates of either calcite or aragonite crystals with
              varied morphologies and three-dimensional arrangements.
              Classically, every aspect of the fabrication of microstructural
              aggregates is attributed to the action of proteins. There was,
              however, only direct evidence that the mineral phase, and
              indirect evidence that nucleation and the crystal shape, are
              determined by the types of soluble proteins. Some authors imply
              that crystal competition may also play a role. In addition, the
              fabrication of intergranular organic matrices typical of some
              microstructures (nacre, columnar prismatic) cannot have a
              protein-based explanation. Over the last decade I and
              collaborators have been applying a holistic view, based on
              analyzing and interpreting the features of both the organic
              (mantle, extrapallial space, periostracum, organic matrices) and
              inorganic (crystallite morphology, arrangement, and
              crystallography) components of the biomineralization system. By
              interpreting them on biophysical principles, we have accumulated
              evidence that, in addition to the activity of proteins, other
              mechanisms contribute in an essential way to the organization of
              molluscan microstructures. In particular, we have identified
              processes such as: (1) crystal nucleation on preformed membranes,
              (2) nucleation and growth of crystals between and within
              self-organized membranes, (3) active subcellular processes of
              contact recognition and deposition. In summary, besides the
              activity of organic macromolecules, physical (crystal
              competition, self-organization) and/or biological (direct
              cellular activity) processes may operate in the fabrication of
              microstructures. The balance between the physical and biological
              determinants varies among microstructures, with some being based
              exclusively on either physical or biological processes, and
              others having a mixed nature. Other calcifying invertebrates
              (e.g., corals, cirripeds, serpulids) secrete microstructures that
              are very similar to inorganic crystal aggregates, and only some
              brachiopods and, to a lesser extent, bryozoans may have secretory
              abilities comparable to those of molluscs. Here I provide a new
              perspective, which may allow microstructures to be understood in
              terms of evolutionary constraints, to compare the secretional
              abilities among taxa, and even to evaluate the probability of
              mimicking microstructures for the production of functional
              synthetic materials.",

              unclear how they impact the oxygen concentration and pH of the

              environment will affect eco-evolutionary dynamics in a context of

              environment in Southern California to understand changes in
              dissolved oxygen (DO) and pH with high spatiotemporal resolution.
              We then examined transgenerational effects using sea urchins
              (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) as our study organism. Using
              enclosures on the benthos, we conditioned adult sea urchins in
              situ at two locations -- one inside the kelp forest and one
              outside the kelp forest. After a 11-week conditioning period
              timed to coincide with gametogenesis in the adults, the urchins
              were collected, spawned, and cultures of their progeny were
              raised in the laboratory in order to assess their performance to
              simulated ocean acidification. In terms of the physical
              observations, we observed significant changes in DO and pH not
              only when comparing sites inside and outside of the kelp forest,
              but also between surface and benthic sensors at the same site. DO
              and pH at the benthos differed in mean, the amplitude of the diel
              signal, and in the profile of background noise of the signal.
              Ultimately, these results indicated that both DO and pH were more
              predictably variable inside of the kelp forest environment. On
              the biological side, we found that adult sea urchins inside the
              kelp forest produced more protein-rich eggs that developed into
              more pH-resilient embryos. Overall, this study in a temperate
              kelp forest ecosystem is one of the first studies to not only
              observe biological response to highly characterized environmental
              variability in situ, but also to observe such changes in a

              There is open discussion regarding whether low D3 is caused by
              the infection or if deficiency negatively affects immune defense.
              The aim of this study was to collect further evidence on this
              topic. METHODS: Systematic literature search was performed to
              identify retrospective cohort as well as clinical studies on
              COVID-19 mortality rates versus D3 blood levels. Mortality rates
              from clinical studies were corrected for age, sex, and diabetes.
              Data were analyzed using correlation and linear regression.
              RESULTS: One population study and seven clinical studies were
              identified, which reported D3 blood levels preinfection or on the
              day of hospital admission. The two independent datasets showed a
              negative Pearson correlation of D3 levels and mortality risk
              (r(17) = -0.4154, p = 0.0770/r(13) = -0.4886, p = 0.0646). For
              the combined data, median (IQR) D3 levels were 23.2 ng/mL
              (17.4-26.8), and a significant Pearson correlation was observed
              (r(32) = -0.3989, p = 0.0194). Regression suggested a theoretical
              point of zero mortality at approximately 50 ng/mL D3.
              CONCLUSIONS: The datasets provide strong evidence that low D3 is
              a predictor rather than just a side effect of the infection.

               shallow-water mussels were heavier (dry weight = 0.004L2.297)

               0.0002L1.726 and 2.5 $\pm$ 1.1 mg cm?3), primarily because of a
               nearly twofold greater carbohydrate store. In the shallow zone,
               females contained more carbohydrates (on average 5.8\% dry
               weight) than males (3.8\% dry weight) because females conserve
               energy for reproduction. Differences in physiologic variables,
               and subsequently physiologic performance of the mussels, were
               related to different nutritional conditions in the ambient
               water. The deep habitat had lower Chl a, averaging 1.1 mg L?1,
               total particulate matter (TPM) 4.3 mg L?1 and particulate
               organic matter (POM) 1.1\% of TPM as compared with the shallow

               increase in the food availability in the water column, which
               allowed efficient colonization of the deep zone by the mussels;
               however, the dominance of males over females (~3 : 1) suggests
               that the food sustains only spawning-related metabolic demands
               and is not sufficient for energy conservation in this zone.

               decrease has a negative effect on calcification in hermatypic
               corals and other calcifying organisms. We report the results of
               three laboratory experiments designed specifically to separate
               the effects of the different carbonate chemistry parameters (pH,
               CO3-2, CO2 [aq], total alkalinity [AT], and total inorganic
               carbon [CT]) on the calcification, photosynthesis, and
               respiration of the hermatypic coral Acropora eurystoma. The
               carbonate system was varied to change pH (7.9-8.5), without
               changing CT; CT was changed keeping the pH constant, and CT was
               changed keeping the pCO2 constant. In all of these experiments,
               calcification (both light and dark) was positively correlated
               with CO3-2 concentration, suggesting that the corals are not
               sensitive to pH or CT but to the CO3-2 concentration. A decrease
               of ~30\% in the CO3-2 concentration (which is equivalent to a
               decrease of about 0.2 pH units in seawater) caused a
               calcification decrease of about 50\%. These results suggest that
               calcification in today's ocean (pCO2 = 370 ppm) is lower by
               ~20\% compared with preindustrial time (pCO2 = 280 ppm). An
               additional decrease of ~35\% is expected if atmospheric CO2
               concentration doubles (pCO2 = 560 ppm). In all of these
               experiments, photosynthesis and respiration did not show any
               significant response to changes in the carbonate chemistry of
               seawater. Based on this observation, we propose a mechanism by
               which the photosynthesis of symbionts is enhanced by coral
               calcification at high pH when CO2(aq) is low. Overall it seems
               that photosynthesis and calcification support each other mainly
               through internal pH regulation, which provides CO3-2 ions for
               calcification and CO2(aq) for photosynthesis.",

               different temperatures in dark and light (250 µmol photon m?2
               s?1) conditions. At one temperature (24ºC) the respiration rate
               increased as a power function of the foraminiferan organic
               carbon mass with a 0.57 $\pm$ 0.18 exponent. The effect of
               temperature on respiration was quantified in two ways: by
               normalizing the rates to the organic carbon mass and by
               normalizing the observed rates to a constant temperature (24ºC).
               This latter normalization was also used for photosynthesis. The
               respiration rates increase as a function of temperature for all
               species and can be described either with a Q10 = 3.18

               44Ca-labeling and NanoSIMS isotopic imaging of its test. We

               component of passively transported (e.g., by endocytosis)

               surface zonal-mean values. That represents more than a 10-fold
               improvement relative to outdated versions of the same packages.
               Differences between packages grow with depth for some computed
               variables but remain small. Discrepancies derive largely from
               differences in equilibrium constants. Analysis of the
               sensitivity of each computed variable to changes in each
               constant reveals the general dominance of K1 and K2 but also the
               comparable sensitivity to KB for the AT--CT input pair.
               Best-practice formulations for K1 and K2 are implemented
               consistently among packages. Yet with more recent formulations
               designed to cover a wider range of salinity, packages disagree
               by up to 8 $\mu$atm in pCO2, 0.006 units in pH, and 1 $\mu$mol
               kg−1 in CO32− under typical surface conditions. They use
               different proposed sets of coefficients for these formulations,
               all of which are inconsistent. Users would do well to use
               up-to-date versions of packages and the constants recommended
               for best practices.",

  title     = "Impact of seawater carbonate chemistry on the calcification of
               marine bivalves",
  author    = "Thomsen, J and Haynert, K and Wegner, K M and Melzner, F",
  abstract  = "Abstract. Bivalve calcification, particularly of the early
               larval stages, is highly sensitive to the change in ocean
               carbonate chemistry resulting from atmospheric CO2 uptake.
               Earlier studies suggested that declining seawater [CO32−] and
               thereby lowered carbonate saturation affect shell production.
               However, disturbances of physiological processes such as
               acid-base regulation by adverse seawater pCO2 and pH can affect
               calcification in a secondary fashion. In order to determine the
               exact carbonate system component by which growth and
               calcification are affected it is necessary to utilize more
               complex carbonate chemistry manipulations. As single factors,
               pCO2 had no effects and [HCO3-] and pH had only limited effects
               on shell growth, while lowered [CO32−] strongly impacted
               calcification. Dissolved inorganic carbon (CT) limiting
               conditions led to strong reductions in calcification, despite
               high [CO32−], indicating that [HCO3-] rather than [CO32−] is the
               inorganic carbon source utilized for calcification by mytilid
               mussels. However, as the ratio [HCO3-] / [H+] is linearly
               correlated with [CO32−] it is not possible to differentiate
               between these under natural seawater conditions. An equivalent
               of about 80 $\mu$mol kg−1 [CO32−] is required to saturate
               inorganic carbon supply for calcification in bivalves. Below
               this threshold biomineralization rates rapidly decline. A
               comparison of literature data available for larvae and juvenile
               mussels and oysters originating from habitats differing
               substantially with respect to prevailing carbonate chemistry
               conditions revealed similar response curves. This suggests that
               the mechanisms which determine sensitivity of calcification in
               this group are highly conserved. The higher sensitivity of
               larval calcification seems to primarily result from the much
               higher relative calcification rates in early life stages. In
               order to reveal and understand the mechanisms that limit or
               facilitate adaptation to future ocean acidification, it is
               necessary to better understand the physiological processes and
               their underlying genetics that govern inorganic carbon
               assimilation for calcification.",

@ARTICLE{Bach2015-dz,
  title     = "Reconsidering the role of carbonate ion concentration in
               calcification by marine organisms",
  author    = "Bach, L T",
  abstract  = "Abstract. Marine organisms precipitate 0.5--2.0 Gt of carbon as
               calcium carbonate (CaCO3) every year with a profound impact on
               global biogeochemical element cycles. Biotic calcification
               relies on calcium ions (Ca2+) and usually on bicarbonate ions
               (HCO3−) as CaCO3 substrates and can be inhibited by high proton
               (H+) concentrations. The seawater concentration of carbonate
               ions (CO32−) and the CO32−-dependent CaCO3 saturation state
               ($\Omega$CaCO3) seem to be irrelevant in this production
               process. Nevertheless, calcification rates and the success of
               calcifying organisms in the oceans often correlate surprisingly
               well with these two carbonate system parameters. This study
               addresses this dilemma through the rearrangement of carbonate
               system equations which revealed an important proportionality
               between [CO32−] or $\Omega$CaCO3and the ratio of [HCO3−] to
               [H+]. Due to this proportionality, calcification rates will
               always correlate as well with [HCO3−] / [H+] as they do with
               [CO32−] or $\Omega$CaCO3 when temperature, salinity, and
               pressure are constant. Hence, [CO32−] and $\Omega$CaCO3 may
               simply be very good proxies for the control by [HCO3−] / [H+],
               where [HCO3−] serves as the inorganic carbon substrate and [H+]
               functions as a calcification inhibitor. If the
               ``substrate--inhibitor ratio'' (i.e., [HCO3−] / [H+]) rather
               than [CO32−] or $\Omega$CaCO3 controls biotic CaCO3 formation,
               then some of the most common paradigms in ocean acidification
               research need to be reviewed. For example, the absence of a
               latitudinal gradient in [HCO3−] / [H+] in contrast to [CO32−]
               and $\Omega$CaCO3 could modify the common assumption that high
               latitudes are affected most severely by ocean acidification.",

               kinetics and thermodynamic isotope exchange reactions are
               required to derive seawater pH from $\delta$11B biogenic

               Crassostrea virginica (16.03 ‰). These results are discussed in
               the context of each species' proposed mechanism of

               uncertainties and volume-dependent differences in $\delta$11B
               variations are taken into account for these methods, the
               intra-shell variability is estimated to be on the order of ∼3 ‰
               and ∼0.4 ‰ (2$\sigma$) on a ∼20 and 100 µm scale, respectively.
               In comparison, the $\delta$11B variability between shells
               exhibits a total range of ∼3 ‰ for both techniques, suggesting
               that several shells need to be analyzed for accurate mean
               $\delta$11B values. Based on a simple resampling method, we
               conclude that ∼12 shells of C. wuellerstorfi must be analyzed
               using LA-MC-ICPMS to obtain an accurate average value within
               $\pm$0.5 ‰ (2$\sigma$) to resolve pH variations of ∼0.1. Based
               on our findings, we suggest preferring the conventional bulk
               solution MC-ICPMS over the in situ methods for paleo-pH studies,
               for example. However, SIMS and LA provide powerful tools for
               high-resolution paleoreconstructions, or for investigating
               ontogenetic trends in $\delta$11B.",

               associated impacts on calcifying organisms, is accumulating.
               Among these organisms, benthic and planktonic foraminifera are
               responsible for a large amount of the globally precipitated
               calcium carbonate. Hence, their response to an acidifying ocean
               may have important consequences for future inorganic carbon
               cycling. To assess the sensitivity of benthic foraminifera to
               changing carbon dioxide levels and subsequent alteration in
               seawater carbonate chemistry, we cultured specimens of the
               shallow water species Ammonia tepida at two concentrations of
               atmospheric CO2 (230 and 1900 ppmv) and two temperatures (10 °C
               and 15 °C). Shell weights and elemental compositions were
               determined. Impact of high and low pCO2 on elemental composition

               was observed even in the presence of calcium carbonate
               under-saturation, and also decrease with increasing temperature.
               Thus both warming and ocean acidification may act to decrease
               shell weights in the future. Changes in [CO32−] or total
               dissolved inorganic carbon do not affect the Mg distribution
               coefficient. On the contrary, Sr incorporation is enhanced under
               increasing [CO32−]. Implications of these results for the

  abstract  = "Abstract. Submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) is an important
               gateway for nutrients and pollutants from land to sea. While
               understanding SGD is crucial for managing nearshore ecosystems
               and coastal freshwater reserves, studying this discharge is
               complicated by its occurrence at the limit between land and sea,
               a dynamic environment. This practical difficulty is exacerbated
               by the significant spatial and temporal variability. Therefore,
               to capture the magnitude of SGD, a variety of techniques and
               measurements, applied over multiple periods, is needed. Here, we
               combine several geophysical methods to detect zones of fresh
               submarine groundwater discharge (FSGD) in the intertidal zone,
               upper beach, dunes, and shallow coastal area. Both terrestrial
               electrical-resistivity tomography (ERT; roll-along) and marine
               continuous resistivity profiling (CRP) are used from the shallow
               continental shelf up to the dunes and combined with frequency
               domain electromagnetic (FDEM) mapping in the intertidal zone. In
               particular, we apply an estimation of robust apparent electrical
               conductivity (rECa) from FDEM data to provide reliable lateral
               and vertical discrimination of FSGD zones. The study area is a
               very dynamic environment along the North Sea, characterized by
               semi-diurnal tides between 3 and 5 m. CRP is usually applied in
               calmer conditions, but we prove that such surveys are possible
               and provide additional information to primarily land-bound ERT
               surveying. The 2D inversion models created from ERT and CRP data
               clearly indicate the presence of FSGD on the lower beach or
               below the low-water line. This discharge originates from a
               potable freshwater lens below the dunes and flows underneath a
               thick saltwater lens, present from the dunes to the lower sandy
               beach, which is fully observed with ERT. Freshwater outflow
               intensity has increased since 1980, due to a decrease of
               groundwater pumping in the dunes. FDEM mapping at two different
               times reveals discharge at the same locations, clearly displays
               the lateral variation of the zone of discharge, and suggests
               that FSGD is stronger at the end of winter compared to the
               beginning of autumn. ERT, CRP, and FDEM are complementary tools
               in the investigation of SGD. They provide a high-resolution 3D
               image of the saltwater and freshwater distribution in the
               phreatic coastal aquifer over a relatively large area, both off-

              element data of cultures under variable seawater chemistry",
  abstract = "The process by which foraminifera precipitate calcite from
              seawater has received much attention, in part because a
              mechanistic basis for empirical calibrations between shell
              chemistry and environmental parameters is desirable given their
              widespread application in palaeoceanography. The incorporation of
              fluorescent membrane-impermeable molecules into the shell
              demonstrates that seawater, transported by vacuolisation, is
              present at the site of calcification. However, recent discussion
              has focused on whether the calcium required for chamber formation
              is sourced predominantly by transmembrane Ca transport (TMT),
              with seawater vacuolisation playing a passive role, or vice
              versa. This debate has arisen in part because of the need to
              explain the low Mg/Ca ratio of most foraminifera compared to
              inorganic calcite. Here, we present trace element data of
              Operculina ammonoides and Globigerinoides ruber, a high-Mg
              shallow benthic, and low-Mg planktonic species respectively,
              cultured under variable seawater carbonate and elemental
              chemistries. We find that Mg incorporation in high and low-Mg
              species is characterised by an opposite response to the carbonate
              system, demonstrating that the negative relationship between
              Mg/Ca and pH or [ CO 3 2 - ] in several low-Mg foraminifera is
              not an intrinsic feature of foraminiferal (or inorganic) calcite
              precipitation. Therefore, any biomineralisation model must be
              able to explain why the mechanism by which seawater Mg/Ca is
              reduced is impacted by the carbonate system. Moreover, we show
              that trace element incorporation in G. ruber is consistent with
              Rayleigh fractionation from unmodified seawater except for
              Mg-removal, but in very poor agreement with a biomineralisation
              site [Ca] substantially elevated above that of seawater as
              required by the TMT hypothesis. In addition, any
              biomineralisation model must explain the nonlinear relationship
              between seawater and shell Mg/Ca, and the large number of
              seawater vacuoles observed in some species. Although there are
              important inter-species differences in biomineralisation, evident
              from the observed range of shell Mg/Ca ratios, we argue that
              these differences are mechanistically related to the degree of Mg
              exclusion prior to chamber formation. Indeed, whilst our data for
              both low-Mg and high-Mg species are consistent with
              biomineralisation via ions sourced through seawater
              vacuolisation, it is difficult to reconcile many of these
              observations with a model based on significant transmembrane Ca
              transport.",

              tissues are brittle or fragile, while plants grown on high boron
              levels may have unusually flexible or resilient tissues. Borate
              forms cyclic diesters with appropriate diols or polyols. The most
              stable are formed with cis-diols on a furanoid ring. Two
              compounds have this structure physiologically: ribose in
              ribonucleotides and RNA, and apiose in the plant cell wall.
              Germanium can substitute for boron in carrot cell cultures. Both
              boron and germanium are localized primarily in the cell wall. We
              postulate that borate-apiofuranose ester cross-links are the
              auxin-sensitive acid-growth link in vascular plants, that the
              cyanobacterial heterocyst envelope depends on borate
              cross-linking of mannopyranose and/or galactopyranose residues in
              a polysaccharide-lipid environment, and that boron in diatoms
              forms ester cross-links in the polysaccharide cell wall matrix
              rather than boron-silicon interactions. Complexing of
              ribonucleotides is probably a factor in boron toxicity.",

               protein damage in natural populations of the intertidal mussel
               Mytilus trossulus. In order to compare the state of protein
               pools during seasonal variations in environmental temperature,
               we used solid-phase immunochemical analysis to quantify
               ubiquitin conjugate concentrations and relative levels of the
               stress protein hsp70. The two biochemical indices were selected
               for their cellular roles in irreversible and reversible protein
               denaturation, respectively. Proteins that are ubiquitinated are
               irreversibly damaged and are degraded by intracellular
               proteases; stress proteins act as molecular chaperones to
               re-fold thermally denatured proteins and, thus, indicate degrees
               of reversible protein damage. Comparisons involved mussels
               collected in February and August from two study sites: an
               intertidal site which subjected animals to a wide range of body
               temperatures (from approximately 10 to 35 C in summer), and a
               subtidal site where animals remained submerged throughout the
               tidal cycle. Our results show that quantities of ubiquitin
               conjugates and hsp70 were greater in gill tissue from
               summer-collected mussels than in gills of winter-collected
               specimens. Ubiquitin conjugate and hsp70 levels were also
               greater in mussels collected from an intertidal location than in
               mussels from a submerged population. Our results show that the
               high summer temperatures normally experienced in the field are
               sufficient to cause increased denaturation of cellular proteins.
               Despite increases in the concentrations of heat shock proteins
               in summer-acclimatized mussels, elevated levels of irreversibly
               denatured, i.e. ubiquitinated, proteins were still observed,
               which indicates that the heat shock response may not be able to
               rescue all heat-damaged proteins. The energy costs associated
               with replacing heat-damaged proteins and with maintaining the
               concentrations and activities of heat shock proteins may
               contribute substantially to cellular energy demands. These
               increased energy demands may have an impact on the ecological
               energetic relationships of species, e.g. in the allocations of
               energy for growth and reproduction, and, as a consequence, may

              not implemented until the motorisation of the masses in the 1960s
              caused an increasing environmental burden. The rising air
              pollution was considered a latent danger for humans, animals and
              plants. In the years up to 1985 the EU passed several regulations
              to limit the mass pollutants CO, CxHy and NOx. Germany was the
              first EU-member nation to also be concerned with lead in
              gasoline, passing reduction regulations as early as in 1971. In
              1986, several EU-member nations implemented the supply of
              unleaded gasoline. This decision was predominantly based on
              information about widespread forest damage. The reduction of lead
              emissions due to these regulations could be verified in different
              environmental systems. An example of this was the decline of
              atmospheric lead concentrations and human blood lead levels in
              Germany. The German mineral oil and automobile markets were also
              affected. The price trend of unleaded fuel was heavily influenced
              by tax incentives which benefited not only the gasoline traders
              but also the consumers. With regard to the distribution system,
              the market positions particularly of the medium-sized traders and
              the independent importers were weakened. In the automobile
              market, favourable terms of competition were experienced by
              producers who had already gained experience with catalyst systems
              in the U.S.-market. The gasoline lead content regulations had no
              effects on further economic indicators, except for competition.
              (orig.) [German] Infolge der Massenmotorisierung in den 60er
              Jahren stieg die Umweltbelastung durch den Automobilverkehr stark
              an. Luftverschmutzung durch Kraftfahrzeuge wurde erstmalig als
              latente Gefahr fuer die Gesundheit von Mensch, Tier und Pflanze
              wahrgenommen. Dies charakterisierte den Beginn der Umweltpolitik
              im Automobilsektor. Bis 1985 verabschiedete die Europaeische
              Union (EU) mehrere Rahmenrichtlinien zur Reduktion der
              Luftschadstoffe CO, CxHy und NOx. 1971 war Deutschland das erste
              europaeische Land, das Gesetze zur Reduktion des Bleigehalts in
              Benzin erliess. Vor dem Hintergrund der Diskussion um die Gefahr
              des Waldsterbens wurde seit 1985 nicht nur in Deutschland,
              sondern ab 1986 auch in einigen anderen Laendern der EU
              bleifreies Benzin angeboten. Mit zeitlicher Verzoegerung fuehrten
              diese gesetzlichen Massnahmen zur Reduktion der
              Bleikonzentrationen in verschiedenen Umweltmedien, wie z.B. in
              der Atmosphaere oder auch im Menschen. Oekonomische Auswirkungen
              hatte die Bleireduktion im Benzin in Deutschland vor allem auf
              die Mineraloel- und Automobilindustrie. Dabei war die
              Preisentwicklung fuer bleifreies Benzin durch steuerliche Anreize
              stark beeinflusst, die nicht nur den Handel, sondern auch die
              Autofahrer beguenstigte. Im Automobilsektor profitierten
              vorwiegend die Hersteller, die bereits durch Exporte auf den
              US-Markt Erfahrungen mit abgasarmen Techniken, wie z.B. dem
              Katalysator, gesammelt hatten. Abgesehen vom Wettbewerb, hatte

  abstract = "Temporal and spatial patterns of phenotypic variation have
              traditionally been thought to reflect genetic differentiation
              produced by natural selection. Recently, however, there has been
              growing interest in how natural selection may shape the genetics
              of phenotypic plasticity to produce patterns of geographic
              variation and phenotypic evolution. Because the covariance
              between genetic and environmental influences can modulate the
              expression of phenotypic variation, a complete understanding of
              geographic variation requires determining whether these
              influences covary in the same (cogradient variation) or in
              opposing (countergradient variation) directions. We focus on
              marine snails from rocky intertidal shores as an ideal system to
              explore how genetic and plastic influences contribute to
              geographic and historical patterns of phenotypic variation.
              Phenotypic plasticity in response to predator cues, wave action,
              and water temperature appear to exert a strong influence on small
              and large-scale morphological variation in marine snails. In
              particular, plasticity in snail shell thickness: (i) may
              contribute to phenotypic evolution, (ii) appears to have evolved
              across small and large spatial scales, and (iii) may be driven by
              life history trade-offs tied to architectural constraints imposed
              by the shell. The plasticity exhibited by these snails represents
              an important adaptive strategy to the pronounced heterogeneity of
              the intertidal zone and undoubtedly has played a key role in
              their evolution.",

  abstract = "Boron consists of only of two isotopes with a relatively large
              mass difference (~10 \%). It is also volatile in acidic media and
              prone to contamination during analytical treatment. Nevertheless,
              an increasing number of isotope laboratories are successfully
              using boron isotope compositions (expressed in $\delta$11B) in
              marine biogenic carbonates to reconstruct seawater pH. Recent
              interlaboratory comparison efforts [1] highlighted the existence
              of a relatively high level of disagreement between laboratories
              when measuring such material, so in order to further strengthen
              the validity of this carbonate system proxy, appropriate
              reference materials need to be urgently characterised. We
              describe here the latest results of the Boron Isotope
              Intercomparison Project (BIIP) where we aim to characterise the
              boron isotopic composition of two marine carbonates: Japanese
              Geological Survey carbonate standard materials JCp-1 (coral
              porites) [2] and JCt-1 (Giant Clam) [3]. This boron isotope
              interlaboratory comparison study has two aims: (i) to assess to
              what extent chemical pre-treatment, aimed at removing organic
              material, can influence the resulting carbonate $\delta$11B; (ii)
              to determine the isotopic composition of the two reference
              materials with a number of analytical techniques to provide the
              community with reference $\delta$11B values for JCp-1 and JCt-1
              and to further explore any differences related to analytical
              technique. In total eight isotope laboratories participated, of
              which one determined $\delta$11B via negative thermal ionisation
              mass spectrometry (NTIMS) and seven used multi collector
              inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC-ICPMS). For the
              latter several different introduction systems and chemical
              purification methods were used. Overall the results are
              strikingly consistent between the participating labs. The
              oxidation of organic material slightly lowered the median
              $\delta$11B by ~0.1 ‰ for both JCp-1 and JCt-1, while the mean
              $\delta$11B of all labs for both standards was lowered by 0.20 ‰
              for JCp-1 and 0.15 ‰ for JCt-1, hence within uncertainty of the
              reported values. With the exception of one MC-ICPMS lab that
              provided significantly lower JCp-1 $\delta$11B data for
              unoxidised material (1.7 ‰ below median), the remaining JCp-1
              results reproduced within $\pm$ 0.54 ‰ for unoxidised (n=21) and
              $\pm$ 0.37 ‰ for oxidised standards (n=21). The JCt-1 standards
              did not reproduce as well, resulting in a 2 s.d. of 1.0 ‰ for
              both unoxidised and oxidised powders (n=21) and in places the
              effect of oxidation appeared to be laboratory dependent.
              Exclusion of one MC-ICPMS lab resulted in an improved
              reproducibility of 0.52 ‰ (n=18) for oxidised JCt-1 material. The
              mean difference for the two standard materials in the respective
              labs (i.e., ∆$\delta$11B = mean $\delta$11B(JCp-1) - mean
              $\delta$11B(JCt-1)) was 7.9 $\pm$ 0.9 ‰ for unoxidised (n=7) and
              8.1 $\pm$ 0.7 ‰ for oxidised standards (n=7). In this
              presentation emphasis will also be placed on distinguishing
              factors leading to increased/decreased interlaboratory
              consistency during the preparation and analysis of biogenic
              carbonates for other isotopic systems. References [1] Foster,

              culturing. This technique is based on the addition of the minor
              stable isotope W a (natural abun-dance 0.19\%) to seawater. The
              extent of CaZ+ uptake by foraminifera can be assessed by
              determination of the 48/44Ca of the cultured shells using plasma
              mass spec-trometry. This new technique could also be used to
              as-sess Ca2-uptake in other CaC0,-secreting organisms. Results
              from labeling experiments indicate that almost all the CaZ-in the
              terminal spherical chamber of the planktonic foraminifer Orbulina
              universa is in isotopic equilibrium with the surrounding
              seawater. Only a very small fraction (<0.15 pg CaCO, equivalent,
              or 0.5\% of average final shell mass) is likely to come from some
              other pool. If our results apply generally to the precip-itation
              of foraminifera shells, they suggest that an inter-nal
              cytoplasmic Ca2+ pool probably does not provide a means by which
              seawater cation ratios can be fraction-ated. We have also applied
              the new labeling technique to the determination of incremental
              calcification rates in Orbulina universa. Our results indicate
              that adult cal-cification in individuals grown under high light
              is up to three times greater than for individuals grown in the
              dark. This difference is directly attributable to the role
              symbionts play in enhancing calcification. The enhance-ment in
              calcification rate is close to the calculated in-crease in
              carbonate ion due to the photosynthetic activity of the
              symbionts, suggesting that calcification rate in 0. universa is
              proportional to the degree of carbonate sat-uration.",
